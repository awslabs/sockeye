New doctors <unk> strike calls for new protests
The new doctors call on their trade unions to launch protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association <unk> LMA <unk> the New External Committee <unk> JAK <unk> intends to request the advice of the Council to support wider protests at the beginning of September.
JAK believes that ministers have failed to dispel the doubts about the Treaty.
In July <unk> young doctors and medical students rejected the LPA.
58% of all members voted against the contract.
On Thursday evening <unk> a message published by the JAK Council <unk> Elna Makcorta <unk> shows that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the offer of the agreement has been rejected.
She said <unk> <unk> As a result of the JAK vote <unk> the agreement has been fully rejected and decided to demand new formal negotiations to discuss key issues. <unk>
In response to the silence of the government <unk> the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the drafting of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute <unk> young doctors have taken six strikes <unk> including <unk> for the first time in NHS history.
After the vote <unk> which rejected the terms of the agreement proposed by the LPA <unk> the new external representation of the new foreign affairs chief Dr. Johans Malawana was resigned by the new doctor.
A meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students <unk> he said to BMA that the offer is good and will be adopted.
After the vote <unk> Health Secretary James Hant said that the contract would be concluded with the English mediators.
Russia and Turkey <unk> Open alliance <unk>
The one that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to rotate and declare eight months of words and the end of the economic sanctions.
But Vladimir Putin greet Turkish leaders at the St Petersburg Palace <unk> the impression was that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
However <unk> both rounds.
Vladimir Putin looked at the smarter and did not give up warm emotions <unk> even in view of his normal reticence.
On the other hand <unk> Mr Erdogan said at least five times what he called a <unk> garden friend <unk> <unk> a storm meeting.
I felt the number.
He said that relations with Russia would not only improve the level of pre-crisis <unk> but it will become stronger.
Next day <unk> a newspaper reported that Erdogan was beaten as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm gives rise to contradictory feeling.
However <unk> the message from Putin has shown that the Russian leadership has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the trickery of Russian aircraft at the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted sharply at that time.
Putin accustomed Ankara that it had led to the Moscow in the back of Moscow.
The transfer was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring real confidence will be very difficult <unk> perhaps impossible.
Since November <unk> Russia's public position has changed.
For several months <unk> the government's controlled television spread aggressive insults against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed to have been the Turks.
The most serious was that the family of Erdogan himself has made profits from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State controlled Syrian part.
He has <unk> of course <unk> denied this.
However <unk> the main message of the St Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all <unk> this meeting was just because Putin received President Erdogan's apologies.
Russia could see this as a victory for its kind.
The benefits of Ankara from the peace agreement are obvious.
Firstly <unk> Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which he tried to overthrow.
The numerous terrorist attacks also have shaken his position.
There is also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have led to substantial losses <unk> particularly the ban on charter flights <unk> which <unk> normally every year <unk> provides a influx of several million Russian tourists in Turkish perehouses.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian hardship and chip companies will also be encouraged when regular flights are restored.
They expect a holiday in the Mediterranean to be printed.
This week <unk> public TV sets out a fall in prices for fruit and vegetables due to the resumption of Turkish fruit and vegetable imports.
There is a local newspaper Vedemosti <unk> <unk> the Turistus <unk> tomatoes for us <unk>.
However <unk> the visit was also political motive from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West <unk> in his view <unk> a weak response to the coup attempt.
Everything can also see the frustration of protracted talks about accession to the EU and Putin <unk> which is very happy to take advantage of the situation of Turkey being alienated from the West.
The Russian leader has unquestionably obtained supplementary points in Ankara's eyes <unk> expressing support for its elected government after the coup d'état.
Please take into account that Moscow is well aware of this <unk> because it itself has deeply rooted fears of regime change in the country.
The summit <unk> which took place in this gluble by-catch <unk> gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present <unk> as someone called a analytic <unk> <unk> the all-out alliance <unk> <unk> two countries that feel excluded.
Despite public demonstrations <unk> there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria <unk> where Russia presents itself as a peace media <unk> but in fact Russia and Turkey are supporting the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations without wishing to disclose information <unk> both presidents announced that they had not discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey purposely avoided the issue of disagreement between the two countries <unk> while President Putin wanted to stress that.
There is no clear consensus as to how both countries could find a common language on Syria.
However <unk> after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters <unk> when a NATO member Turkey struck Russia's battle plane <unk> the situation has improved <unk> as the two leaders at least have resumed negotiations.
Scottish Careal Banka will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The STB will continue to play a role in the future <unk> the Executive Director of the Bank has announced.
Outside Scotland <unk> the SKB will no longer be available.
Ross ceiling tells BBC's channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions <unk> because eight years ago the bank was almost bankrupt and required financial assistance.
Meanwhile <unk> experts from the brand behaviour strategy have used the ICC brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors <unk> starting with the Seal Union regeneration and finally with Vimblurton's tennis champion Endy Murees.
However <unk> it is now decided to put forward other national brands.
Scotland's Royal Banaka will be available to Scottish customers <unk> but it will not be paralysed.
In England and Wales all the reference points of the SKB <unk> beyond the head office and the official stock exchange list <unk> will be changed to the name of NatWest.
The <unk> Ulster Bank <unk> is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
The smaller private financial brands such as Coutlet <unk> Adam <unk> Co'Drummond <unk> and Holt's Military Bank will also be noteworthy.
The manoeuvres were interviewed during the journey with customers and staff by InverrheIrish.
He told BBC Scottish's channel <unk> <unk> The ICC will become our brand and with which our workers are working <unk> because we are now becoming more than a brand bank. <unk>
For the time the Bank became a global brand and the ICC became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have a global ambition <unk> we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their own industry and our employees will be treated with customers under these brands.
The SCB has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor <unk> six Nations <unk> and will involve different brands in the sponsorship of sport.
<unk> It is high time to become a brand bank because we have long been asking ourselves the question of how to become a better bank for their customers <unk> <unk> the CEO tells us.
Three years ago <unk> it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and let us develop these brands.
However <unk> thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of the customers <unk> not our own needs <unk> we have obviously achieved a major change.
We can revive these brands once again <unk> so I think that now is the time.

He is a fantastic race <unk> his enthusiasm and hardware attracting fanatics to this type of sport.
A few weeks ago <unk> I said to the Frenchy that he would have fed the 6,000 victories <unk> if only a weekend kill and a great race.
However <unk> it is a real joy that the Frenchy wins on the ground for 30 years in the United Kingdom.
He is a life that fits in the British race and he is an excellent joke.
He went on to say that <unk> we need to make sure that we do better <unk> <unk> he said.

And he could take part in the race for another time <unk> the Detors have previously said that it would be willing to continue to be in the race to at least 50 years old.
Russian President Putin dismissed heads of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpected unexpected President Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in Putina's closest people for many years.
For the moment <unk> the 63 year-old politician has been appointed a Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
In the Kremlin statement <unk> Putin decided to release Ivanov from the head of the Russian President's office <unk> without mentioning the reason.
Antons Vaino <unk> who was his deputy in his post since 2012.

Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov wants to leave the post and the recommendations were as Vaino as his substitute.
Did the smiles convince <unk>
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a scourge and close to Vladimir Putin's ally and <unk> like Putin <unk> worked at the Soviet security service at the time.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
The two men announced that Ivanov resigns from his own initiative.
But notwithstanding the smallest shots of the cameras <unk> rarely this explanation is convinced <unk> especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this a result of the fight for power <unk>
Nobody knows.
However <unk> the official claim that a man who was regarded as a potential president would suddenly want to be a leader of the Russian environment policy is being treated with great scepticism.
Ivanov said in the Kremlin on the Kremlin <unk> <unk> It is a fact that <unk> at the beginning of 2012 <unk> I ask you to entrust this difficult position <unk> could even say <unk> a problem of problematic positions <unk> four years ago.
It appears that I have been in office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov came into office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former GDK National Security Officer <unk> like Putin.
At the end of the 1990s <unk> Putin was led by the Federal Security Service <unk> which is the successor of the KGB <unk> Ivanov held his deputy office.
When Putin came to power <unk> he called Ivanova to five people who are most committed.
At the end of the second term <unk> Ivanov was considered to be the potential candidate for the presidential candidate <unk> as the election of Putin to the third term would be unconstitutional.

The engineers have connected the northern part of the Kine ferry and the vibrant <unk> which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete <unk> which means that the bridge building is coming to an end.

It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel <unk> 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently <unk> the 1.35 billion pound project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The economic Secretary <unk> Keith Brown <unk> was at the place of construction today and was one of the first to go to the bridge.
He said <unk> <unk> This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Kwine-Maintenance bridge. <unk>
In this project we see an unworkable engineering solution <unk> where only the construction of this part used more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the vast majority of the bridge and the size of size <unk> the bridge and the vibrant <unk> it is an extremely delicate process which requires a huge degree of accuracy.
In general <unk> more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the final stage <unk> which will connect with Rositu <unk> today <unk> which means that all parts of the bridge are ready to fall.
The Director of the 4th lunch Connected Project <unk> Michael Martins <unk> said <unk> <unk> The first link is a very important point for any bridge building. <unk>
In this fantastic project <unk> the first link is the demonstration of engineer engineering.
After the last phase of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower <unk> we were able to connect the north of the north with the ground.
This was done <unk> by giving the northern access to the south of the 700 millimeters to the south.

Bailt became a fourth consecutive player in a row that won the multi-year champion and the fifth best practise by gradually strengthening the reputation as the best exercise of its generation and <unk> possibly <unk> the best vintage.
When the final result was announced <unk> she discovered the asard because the long road was at the end of the day.
This achievement follows her side by unfeatured athletes like Maikl Felps <unk> who raised the kind of sport at a different level.
The Bailt has been dominated in the past three years in the form of sport <unk> with 15 medals of the world championships <unk> including 10 gold medals <unk> with the fulfilment of such excellent <unk> accurate and ambitious combinations that the 1980s will be used in the

Simona Bailt <unk> left <unk> and Alija Raismane fed after the golf of gold and silver medal in the individual multi-struggling block for women in 2016.
The first gold medal was won on Tuesday by making special random officers in the Martas Carolji prizes.
Although Bailsa said that he had not been waiting for the lap of the praise <unk> it is not the truth.
Some of her preconditions for the free movement of her particular acroic move are accompanied by a latant music that would fit perfectly on the streets of the Rio Olympics.
It is no coincidence.
The girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a silver and which was revealed by the trees of a third Eimi Eimia Burman on a sports march <unk> where the Church of Burmanure was held.
She has not lost in a multi-fight race since summer 2013 and a series of victory can continue <unk> as long as Bailsa wants.
Although Mustafina was slightly under management during two rotation <unk> it was only an illusion.
The share of the game and free movement - the part of the race <unk> where Bailsa will defend his champion <unk> is still ahead of us.
She was in front of a result 15,433 to the barrel and strengthened the management with the result of the 15.933 free movement.
Raismane their massacred while they expected results <unk> which was only the formality and she was fed into the tears when he was the dream she had previously entered his dream.
Raismanes resulted in a small reprisals for four years of events in which she shared the third place with Mustaf <unk> but lost the fight for the bronze medals.

Why do we need Simona <unk> Gabon and Laurium <unk>
I call this one year for the Olympic Games of the Women's Olympic Games.
Firstly <unk> I have been on all the summer Olympics since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly <unk> there are three miles in this team <unk> Simona Bailsa <unk> Gabon Dugreada and Laurium Hernanopza <unk> which inspired many young girls.
People can be proud that Alija Raismane <unk> who is Jewish and Medison Kociana <unk> which is a Catholicte.
Finally <unk> this team genuinely represents America.
It has also strengthened the presence of the black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
In the last four years <unk> the best exercise is an American of African origin.
Last year <unk> Simona and Gabon took up 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games <unk> Gabon Dugreada became the Olympic champion and the Americas was stifled.
The world has now seen an incredible exercise of the triple world championship in Simona Bailsa <unk> Dugreada and Laurium Hernandeza <unk> with an unprecedented but methythal champion.
Simona became a fourth consecutive one in a row that has acquired a golden part of the individual's personal battle for women.

Simona <unk> Gabon and Laurium entered the Olympic read as well as Alija and Medison.
They are the Olympic Taca <unk> because the next Olympic Games will only be four athletes <unk> and this is the last year of a third <unk> Martas Karolos.
In fact <unk> the exercise is expensive for sport <unk> mainly in private milliony clubs <unk> and they keep their parents paying for coaches <unk> premises <unk> travel <unk> formable <unk> hotels.
Most of these millant clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
These clubs are driving all their coaches <unk> and this is costly and a long way for the families of Latin American families.
Eimia Burman - Hillary Bailt <unk> and Megija Haine - Lauria Hernanopt he has coached his athletes since the two girls began to work with light bullets.
We need to ensure young girls who are inspired by Simona <unk> Gabon and Laurium <unk> cheaper exercise exercises.

German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study <unk> the number of fatalities in the Communist mile of the former East Germany could be much higher than that of the past <unk> but doubts about the true number of victims remain undispersed.
According to the data revealing on Wednesday the Berlin Wall muzeum in Checkpoint Charlie McCreevy from 1945 to 1989-to the border with Western allies and to the subsequent assassination of the Western Communist authorities.
Museum has been studied for years and replaces the number of victims on a daily basis.

He <unk> together with the other researchers from the Berlin Free University <unk> is currently reviewing possible allegations of death at the border <unk> and so far only 260 cases have been approved.
Previously <unk> it was estimated that only the communists were murdered by the Communist Wall.
In the light of those who died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to get to the West through the neighbouring countries <unk> according to this <unk> the number of victims could reach around a thousand.
However <unk> this is far less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie museeum also counts all the cases of suicide of the East German border guard <unk> whether directly linked to their service.
The Museum is also a number of deaths that are not linked to direct violence.
<unk> If the old age from 70 to 80 years after breaking with border controls died from a heart attack <unk> it must be the consequence of this <unk> murderous border <unk> <unk> a Hillary.
However <unk> it is convinced that the distinction needs to be made between the old people who <unk> perhaps <unk> died as a result of the circumventing of their experiences and those whose death has caused long-term waiting for a bus driver at the border.
Regardless of the list of victims <unk> there is no easy list <unk> since the Communist East German authorities did not accumulate such statistics <unk> and researchers have to disclose documents in the various dispassive archives <unk> points out that.
However <unk> the Shadow group has recently introduced new documents and it could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the short term.

In the seventh minutes of Jasa Veremalua <unk> Jasa Veremalua was in the right corner by strengthening Britain to 17 <unk> 0.
After the changeover <unk> Nakarava increased the overweight and had more than a minute before the end of the first half of the year.
Mr Vatanen has avoided a few setbacks of British power and crossed the line by making points.
The compromise was the result of the 29 <unk> 0.
Fiji has been born to play in the regeneration of regeneration <unk> while the British are just learning.
In fact <unk> this is also true.
The British team made a profound change at the lunch <unk> taking the line of the Fiji Islands to four minutes <unk> which <unk> after the first half-time standards <unk> were good until Jos Tuisov <unk> after a fantastic cry.
Denam Norton were able to make points for the British team through a left-left-left-lefe and scored 36 <unk> 7 <unk> but the game was lost <unk> the vicinity of the Southern Sea salani slurch.
There can be no admiration for Fiji's lived attitude.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's winning with another peak at the end of the game.
Fiji could start to celebrate the end of the game <unk> but the British were able to sit down in the room.
In the first half of the day <unk> Fiji conducted Japan with a result of 20 <unk> 5 <unk> while the British were over South Africa <unk> where the two teams were in a very tough battle for the two teams and the south of the team.
During the first half <unk> Kail Brauns put forward Bok in the team <unk> while Dens Norton had crossed the line with the shining lines and brought the ball into the room by providing the British with the brush.
Markus Vatanen <unk> who is a brother of the English Chambia of England <unk> a brighter of force at the end of the game <unk> secured the team and a further silver medal.
The Trenger's battle with cancer inspired by Helena Glover and Heteri Standing in the rotation competitions.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in this race and it is already a lot.
From the first to the last storm <unk> the golden death of the Helena Glover and Heteres Staningas played a particular role in Estacio da Lagoza.
Although there is only two sportspeople in the boat <unk> she spent the atvoice of Robina Villasa <unk> which inspired her up to the second Olympic gold medal in aircracking with women <unk> becoming the first to be the first.
They have undoubtedly dominated <unk> because 39 once they won't have an unprecedented victory.
The two big sportspeople with the bed elegant drove the surface of the water <unk> do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind every gold medals of gold medals <unk> there is a whole team that is working hard for the athletes to continuously improve their performance and the best investment in their success was made by a coach who did not know until 30 months ago.
Having said that <unk> it disappeared as quickly as it emerged.
I had the cancer of a uprising <unk> which is one of those who can operate and it happened.
If not <unk> it would spread through the whole body.
And the situation would be uncontrollable.
It changes your vision slightly.
Train cancer was launched in December 2013.
This trio has done so that it was Vilable to start the recovery at the beginning of 2014 and to reduce the duration of the break up to the minimum if it can be said.
I needed income <unk> so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated the recovery.
I was in hospital and I went to 6 <unk> 10 and even 15 metres long distance <unk> even though the doctor said that a few steps would be sufficient.
All this began.
Aircraft itself is a challenge <unk> but this time it was even bigger.
After victory <unk> the first message was immediately about Williams <unk> who was very worried about the morning and spoke more than usual.
<unk> This was a very emotional week <unk> but it means a great deal for me . <unk>
This only confirms how much it means and how much I <unk> Helene and Robin have worked.
The 3 years with Helene and Robinar have been excellent.
Without Robin <unk> we would not have achieved anything <unk> so much thank him <unk> he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better team or better coaches.
Her Glover and Hetere Standing in five years has not lost sight of it.
It comes at a huge speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 metres <unk> when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to come closer <unk> Stanford and Gloveres were too big.
We felt every moment.
Helena kbanned <unk> <unk> retention rite <unk> retains rolling stock <unk>.
The loss of concentration is indeed important.
We managed to have a good start <unk> but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day we had no intention to overthrow record <unk> but simply to well row and win the race and that was what we did.
It is a year for rest to decide what to do next.
Next month <unk> there will be a breadth of the Glover and Tradial Visit of Straa Basiala.
So far <unk> she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last race.
This would have been too much pressure.
In London <unk> I took some six months to understand that I am the Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it took approximately four minutes.
She said <unk> <unk> It is fantastic. <unk>
There is a unique opportunity to look at the fantastic architectural architecture of Los Angeles.

Kolegova as leader of the Revenue Service <unk> will be changeover to the last. <unk>
In his words <unk> now the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister <unk> Mārim Kucink <unk> the Union of Greens and Farmers <unk> and Finance Minister Danai Reiznie-Ozlai <unk> Greens <unk> EFA <unk> already have <unk> principled <unk>
Rajevskis estimates that both Kucinskis and Reiznie-Ozoom in this government are the <unk> first big decision <unk> <unk> which can affect him as a politician.
If a position is now beginning to change the position of the head of the Revenue Service <unk> then it will have a negative impact on their public administration.
On the agenda for next week's sitting <unk> the Cabinet of Ministers is on the agenda for the transfer of VEAD Kolegova to the post of Director General for the Revenue Service <unk> according to the government's agenda.
Kolegova was nominated by Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola <unk> Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola <unk> following the resignation of Inara Petersone from the service <unk> and when the competition for the Revenue Service's office ended without the result.
On Thursday 11 August <unk> the performance of the Revenue Service's head of the Revenue Service's head of the Revenue Service's head <unk> on Thursday 11 August <unk> was allowed to stand as a candidate for a leader <unk> she could agree.
The Finance Minister later admitted that other candidates for the Revenue Service will not be considered yet.
Raivis Dzintars <unk> head of the National Alliance's Saeima group <unk> said that she was still in favour of Kolegova under the leadership of the Revenue Service.
In Spain <unk> the potential for reducing the budget deficit is a threat to the failure of the government.
On 12 July <unk> a month ago <unk> the European Commission <unk> EC <unk> issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal have not implemented sufficiently ambitious measures to reduce the deficit level to the Euro Zone required 3% of gross domestic product <unk> GDP <unk>.
The figures show that despite the austerity measures implemented <unk> Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4. 4% of GDP and Spain 5. 1%.
However <unk> the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries while establishing fiscal targets for the next time.
One of the reasons why the EC did not introduce sanctions against the two countries is a growing Euro-scepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase.
Critics say that the EC is not consistent in its decisions <unk> from the beginning of the agreement on uniform rules and then unable to apply them to life.
For example <unk> the President of the German Bundesbank <unk> Jenss Veidmant <unk> said that Europe is losing credibility in this way <unk> giving citizens the impression that the European Union's rules are recommendation rather than binding.
Now the EC has proposed and all the Member States have approved the extension of the budget deficit by the end of this year for Portugal and by 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission soyles over the next few months to examine the progress made by both countries while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal have to be prepared to introduce further austerity measures if circumstances require.
The initial forecasts suggest that Portugal's objective could be achieved at a specified time <unk> and this year's deficit could fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product.
This means that <unk> within the framework of the Stability Programme <unk> the government of this country has to implement the austerity measures this year at 0. 25% of GDP.
These measures should be included in this year's budget <unk> with an additional focus on the control of the procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain <unk> the situation is more complicated.
This year <unk> the budget deficit should be reduced to 4. 6% <unk> next year <unk> up to 3. 1% next year and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition <unk> consolidation measures must be 0. 5% of GDP every year in the next two years.
In particular <unk> the fact that the Spanish political parties have been unable to reach an agreement on the formation of the government are particularly difficult for eight months <unk> and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to have early parliamentary elections in the third year.
However <unk> public opinion polls show that the third elections in the political landscape in the country would not change substantially.
The most popular party is still a popular party under the current Prime Minister <unk> Mariano Rahoja <unk> whose election would again gain in less than 33% of the votes.
My popularity has only been multiplied by socialists <unk> while the anti-austerity parties <unk> the Podemos <unk> or <unk> together <unk> we can <unk> and the <unk> Ciudadanos <unk> or <unk> citizens <unk> have a little bit of popularity.
The People's Party wants to have a socialist and <unk> Ciudadanos <unk> involvement in the government <unk> otherwise it will not be possible until mid-October to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval of the 2017 budget.
As a member of the People's Party parliamentary faction <unk> Rafael Hernando <unk> <unk> if the government had failed and the parliamentary elections will <unk> however <unk> be held for the third time <unk> Spain will become a laughing of Europe.
The pure purity in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
Fifteen years later <unk> the activists have said that <unk> unfortunately <unk> the number of waste has been recovered annually and most of the bathing sites are to blame.
The most polluted bathing sites are precisely in Riga.
The Capital Requirements explain that the bathing areas are met daily <unk> but the fight against non-clean visitors is very difficult.
Furthermore <unk> in the case of the rainfall <unk> the waste of dry land can be washed into water <unk> thereby greatly damage its quality.
Apart from Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzeme <unk> the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
Such a communication has been spread this week by campaigns <unk> my sea <unk> the volunteers.
In the fifth consecutive year along the Gulf of Riga <unk> activists have shown that the number of waste left to a hundred metres has risen to a hundred metres.
Unfortunately <unk> this year <unk> its assessment has come to a halt.
<unk> We can see that this year will be a year when the number of waste to beach 100 metres may even exceed 200 units <unk> <unk> says expedience <unk> my sea <unk> Representative Janis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio communication was in the immediate beach <unk> where a voluntary move along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year between different household waste and pivotal clusters had to gather even fluorescent lamps that are left in the seabed.
It is the citizens who are responsible for the pollution and organiser Ulme teic.
<unk> The main source is the beach visitors themselves <unk> since more than half of the total waste is plastics <unk> different waste <unk> from bags <unk> plastics that are already depleted <unk> they can no longer be removed from the waste.
There are also bathing sites between the uncleaned beaches.
For example <unk> nearly 800 waste units have been collected on average per hundred metres per hundred metres <unk> which is critical.
The Campaign organisers also make it clear that they also smoke out on soybean and not alert or ban signs everywhere.
<unk> The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites - Daugavsinks <unk> Varthbubles and Adestrians - are unfortunately very big and far more than the desired or objective to which Latvia is progressing.
The cleaning in Riga on a daily basis <unk> even twice in the summer hottest days <unk> is explained by Usais Vidauskis.
However <unk> the struggle with unclean visitors is very difficult.
We are coming back to this cultural issue.
<unk> Those who do so use alcohol <unk> smoke and do all the things that must not <unk> even the specific signs do not work <unk>.
In this context <unk> KNOR calls on the bathing sites to report to the police as well.
The police can be called <unk> safely <unk> to these violations and thus to fight for all.
Perhaps there may be some new warnings <unk> but as I said <unk> it would hardly change the situation.
<unk> As everyone together simply has to go and be intolerant against such offenders <unk> <unk> he said.
In the meantime <unk> water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time by a Health Inspection <unk> which may ban official bathing sites.
This year <unk> as for other years <unk> water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The situation now is that all 56 bathing sites have all been good and there is no bathing restriction.
<unk> The last time we are analysing the analysis at the end of August <unk> <unk> the Senior Professor at the Environment Health Check Normunds Kadicat.
In the case of heavy rainfall <unk> the waste left can be washed into water.
This may have an impact on its quality <unk> an environmental expert.
The changes in the Russian elite continue - a change in the management of the Putin Administration.
The seat was left <unk>
Vladimir Putin has announced the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would have left the post and will continue to be the President's Special Representative for Nature Conservation <unk> Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes <unk> Putin dedicated to Ivanovam in front of the television camera <unk> <unk> Cienic Sergej Borisvič <unk> <unk> we have been working together and successful for many years. <unk>
I am satisfied with the fact that you are carrying out your duties.
I am well aware of our agreement not to use you as President of this President for more than four years.
I therefore understand your desire to change the scope of the action.
And I hope you will make full use of your knowledge and experience as well.
However <unk> it is highlighted that the administration of the President is a very important job and has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In the light of the forthcoming State Duma elections next month in Russia <unk> it rumours that this step is linked to the fight for power in Russia's political elite.
Ivanov was also known as a possible substitute for the president of Putin <unk> so the claim that he himself wanted to hold the office of President of the President for nature and transport has caused doubts.
According to Lsm.lv Archix <unk> Ivanov is the General Colonel of the GDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been sens and close to the ally of President Vladimir Putin.
He began his gay special services in 1965 with Putin.
Later <unk> Putin became his deputy to the Federal Security Service.
On the other hand <unk> the first Russian President <unk> Boris Yushchina <unk> was appointed Secretary of the Security Council of Russia.
In 2000 <unk> a Ivanova <unk> Information Security Doctrine <unk> was approved following the Putina's election <unk> including the revitalisation of the state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2003 <unk> Sergei Ivanov became a member of the Russian defence <unk> but already in 2005 <unk> the Deputy Prime Minister <unk> Mikhail Fradar <unk> and was responsible for the development of the Russian defence industries and the export of arms exports.
Now <unk> following the abandonment of the head of the presidential administration <unk> Ivanov will also maintain a seat in the Russian National Security Council <unk> where the new President of the President <unk> Vaino <unk> will also work.
The picture comes from the family of the family council.
The President of the President <unk> Mr Vaino <unk> said himself as Ivanov.
We are familiar with Antonu Eduardoviour.
Then <unk> from the time when you worked under the government.
And for the last almost five years we have been in touch every day.
<unk> I am therefore convinced that he is ready for this work after all professional and personal qualities <unk> <unk> Ivanov said.
The picture comes from a family belonging to the Soviet-party elite.
His grandfather Karls took office in the Estonian Communist Party <unk> including ten years until 1988.
The media edition <unk> Meduza <unk> with a reference to book <unk> Estonian self-determination and independence <unk> writes that at the end of the 80s <unk> Karls Vaino has asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators.
However <unk> he had received a refusal and had lost his office shortly.
Shortly afterwards <unk> Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino is absolated by Moscow's International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However <unk> he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's minutes.
It has already been reported that the last non-Danish Russia has been shaken by the replanting and even arrests of several high-ranking officials <unk> including the replacement of Governor of several regions and federal representatives.
President Vladimir Putin resembles the ruling elite ahead of the elections in 2018.
One of the main features <unk> the increasing number of senior positions <unk> is the representatives of the forces.
The jugitive boldness in the first battle for the Olympics is also in jail.
This was a fight for the first time <unk> and Latvian Janis Vejonis has concluded its participation in the Olympic Games in 17.
Treng Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that I had very little hope <unk> and that was already clear before the competition.
He also revealed that the judo cold was shoulder in the fighting.
It is remarkable that <unk> in order to be at the Olympic Tackling <unk> the Niforents had to be raced in another weight category than the beam - the weight category to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijan cold was 25 kilos heavier.
It has been reported that Jevgenijs Borodavich stood up to 100 kilos of Ryzycool over the last two and a half minutes before the opponent was able to have a clean bill for the game.
So the Rio de judo race was closed.
The people disappeared in Rio.
On Thursday <unk> Yudists Jevgetin Borodavko was entered.
Yes <unk> he was in a more thoughted opponent <unk> but the ambitious sometimes is a surprise.
He missed.
It was even more difficult for the army to be used <unk> as experience has been less and the opponent also.
The outcome is a similar one in tune with a one-and-a-half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately <unk> in recent times <unk> the Latvian jusband has the greatest ambition.
Gunars Kirkevich came from the federation Edge from the federation side of the federation <unk> and his financial star <unk> Alexander Milinkevich <unk> is no longer a <unk> Golden Score <unk>.
Mr Jackevich <unk> who is consulting Kazakh judistus here <unk> and Vsevolcano Zoils will not see the heirs.
But if you do not grow <unk> there will not.
And it is a prerogative of the federation.
This is why <unk> as one of the other finalists <unk> the Rh-Panama screened the promise by the Latvian Federal Federation of Joe Borg.
A flight far from reality.
In the evening <unk> I waited to Samoilovs <unk> the top of the beaches <unk> the Evane <unk> Pee Solberg.
There is no match in the death group.
The Latvian dug had a small derogation - it could have lost <unk> but not more than four points in two faces.
The protracted previous game was beaten.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling was upset above the mud of the crowd.
The wind turbulence has caused additional difficulties.
At the beginning <unk> it would seem to be ours - a more comprehensive ally.
But it did not.
There was simply a simple girl here.
You have so far as Samoilovs and waiting when he will crack.
It was the first at the end of the first phase of the first six months of Canada and at the third beginning <unk> because the load was not the joke.
At that time <unk> it could have been fished because the work was short <unk> but when he was honoured.
Though Samoilovs with Spurs could win two sevenues because the first took over the management of 16 <unk> 15 <unk> but 16 remained at 16.
But we had to lose with 0 <unk> 2 <unk> because the second deficit was -4 <unk> but also thanks to the wind <unk> we managed to win.
A third of the Evane Conservative said.
There was a clear <unk> unconvincing <unk> game <unk> the second match often lide too close to the network and the Samoilovam remained very little for a fruitful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoilovs against the maize <unk> he was more successful this time and it would only be a professional index.
The Kremlin was mistaken <unk> and it was very symbolic that the last bumble block was shot directly.
There was a team.
There was a lack of success this time <unk> in the third six alone <unk> two Evane attacks were close to the coral <unk> but the bumba struck a line.
Two eisi was adjacent to the line.
The controversial episode videos in favour of the opponents also have a video choice.
If the first two games in the first two games with sert <unk> they were very productive.
Everything together was lost on the taboo.
The causes of the failure must be analysed peacefully now.
Perhaps it was like many to live next to stadium <unk> not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
There were two and a half hours.
Perhaps a semi-half-finishing series has been given a little self-confidence.
Perhaps in Cargent he should not have played <unk> but it is sooner to come here and to be more acute.
Perhaps there was a mistake with finding a surge of the athletic form.
So far more than answers.
Our bouchers are over.
The app is over.
What happens next <unk>
There are still some of the World Cup Turkish and the Jurmala <unk> Masters <unk>.
Smoins with Samoilovs have never been friends and will not be <unk> because there are too many personalities.
But this is not necessary.
When the dream of the Olympic medalities collapsed <unk> there may also be a divorce <unk> because the blame will be sought not only in the face but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to distinguish <unk> but it will be much more difficult for Latvia to find a decent partner.
The two brothers play the game <unk> but Janis with Toma has already tried and self-assured <unk> while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start the world's surfaces.
It can be attempted to try and turn the Haraldu Regard <unk> Alexander Millovest <unk> Edgar Top <unk> to the Mārtivist <unk> but it will not be better than this option <unk> which <unk> not once certified at the World Cup stages.
They were smiled at the time.
And all.
We must <unk> of course <unk> take into account the fact that the beach voyage is becoming more popular <unk> new cross <unk> and only the reward is less than two metres.
This is not yet a guarantee of success <unk> but there is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Modern longer is not.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to find themselves in the places offered by games and choose their own.
The US basketball team is on cruise ship <unk> a part of the tennis does not remain in the Olympic village.
Also <unk> part of the beaching voyboybolip has been in the hotel in the collue of Kofi.
This time <unk> there was a strong exaggerated price for journalists at the very modest night.
So the choice also dropped Irish.
The risk is <unk> because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk justifies.
Along with the Irish of Vladimir Vladimir Putin <unk> the use of hardware and the Ipanema border.
Flash at 200 metres away <unk> bone arduous lunch on the march.
Rajon gangs safe because it is a favelas patch <unk> but it must not be forgotten either.
Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Putin is not what some immediately imagined <unk> but the most professional sports journalist in Russian journalist Vladimir Ivanov.
He appears to have been dreamed on Friday morning by another dream dream.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidfielder lasted from his personal record.
There are <unk> however <unk> five more discipline.
After 10 years of disruption <unk> Porgion and Besa <unk> the case is in Liepaja.
In 1973 <unk> the Latvian opera <unk> Porgion and Besa <unk> went to Latvia in the Latvian National Operator.
Since then <unk> the internationally recognised singer has not been beaten.
This is why the organisers of Cethos Arstival and Liepaja art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give audiences the opportunity to enjoy George Gmbasvina here.
<unk> We are very pleased that after the last decade <unk> when Liepaja was able to enjoy opera <unk> this great George Gmbasvina <unk> Porgijs and Besa <unk> opera connose.
Opera <unk> Porgion and Besa <unk> are in a splendid language story of love <unk> its inconsistencies <unk> passion and life tragedies and simple everyday proposals.
It reflects the ancient vitality of the afrost <unk> music and rite.
This is precisely the lack of political correctness in this operation <unk> this exclusion of tolerance makes it so living.
<unk> And yes <unk> this reading is extremely powerful <unk> extremely beautiful and very deep in some way <unk> <unk> says Director General Cairo.
What I love the most - listening or aligning this opera <unk> is always the one-stop points - the famous melocaution <unk> the famous motives <unk> but this transition from one to another.
<unk> It is the most exciting <unk> this building <unk> <unk> the operation is assessed by the opera <unk> Porgijs and Besa <unk> muture-leader and a dirt <unk> Andris Poga.
Operators agree that this is a grand event.
They are very pleased to hear the famous Garoshvina operation in this world.
It is very good that Liepaja can feel the world's elite.
<unk> It's a professional life <unk> <unk> the opera assessed the visitor Edgars Lama.
The concert was a special case for the first time in the open concert <unk> Lielais Certainer <unk> for the first time in the orchestra and for the first time an operational concert took place.
Farmers could name the renovated buildings in the name of Java Rozenal.
Riga Mayor Andris Ameriks said that the museum's address in the future could not be the Valdemar Sta 10a.
Munich director Muny Lorce said that the reregistration of the addressee would result in a long bureaucratic burden <unk> but in general this idea is welcomed and therefore agreed to the local government.
The city of Riga has entered its form in 1936.a year <unk> creating the monument of Burkarda Dzeň's monument to Janim Rozenal <unk> who is standing at the museum.
He was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.

It is said that the National Army museum building on an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation was officially launched this May in May.
This week will finally launch the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Castle.
In total <unk> EUR 11 million will be updated in SIA <unk> Wales <unk>.
It is intended to renovate several Castle facilities <unk> including two spectators <unk> as well as to adapt the buildings to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to mobilise the European Union fund of <unk> six million <unk> but Oleg Burovs <unk> Director of the Riga City Council of Riga City Council <unk> recognises that <unk> for the time being <unk> there is no complete clarity for the project.
<unk> In spite of the political will to start the renovation of VEF culture <unk> by attracting European Structural Funds <unk> we are waiting for a decision <unk> a real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance <unk> to have its money allocated <unk> or no <unk> <unk> says the Bundestag
Last December <unk> we told us that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago <unk> the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that it would take the decision itself that Brussels does not take a decision here.
At the moment <unk> we see that there is yet another discussion <unk> either <unk> we will see what we can expect in the next few days.
<unk> I want to say that the Riga City Council is <unk> without doubt <unk> guaranteed that this process will be launched and concluded within the deadlines <unk> <unk> said Burovs.
As reported <unk> more than a year ago <unk> in March 2015 <unk> VEF Cultural Castle collectively held a deducted concert before the refurbishment of the new buildings.
Although the year passed <unk> the renovation of the building was still not launched and collectively continued to work under unsuitable conditions.
In the Riga City Council <unk> the EEF Cultural Castle's renovation <unk> EEF culture Palace Renovated <unk> is divided into supposedly independent rebuilding work in the clusters <unk> where everyone will ensure different Palace functions.
First <unk> enhancing access to the VEF Cultural Castle <unk> and adapting the surrounding area.
It provides for the orderly surrounding and engineering and renovating the buildings.
Second <unk> improving the supply of ERF Culture.
It plans to improve the performance of buildings <unk> walls and Greeks <unk> theatre and sound recordings <unk> as well as to clean up the building's internal engineering.
Third <unk> improving the working conditions for joint amateur amateurs <unk> which include plans to improve workshops <unk> facilities for heating and ventilation systems.
Before the <unk> Loffensive <unk> <unk> the legitimate group of a legitimate handgroup can be seen in Liepaja.
The exhibition will be characterised by different <unk> Litive <unk> subjects - photographs that have been set up in order to reflect the group's activities from Monday to 2010 when it comes to the end of the group.
There will also be a range of actors <unk> watchdogs <unk> musical instruments <unk> awards and concerts <unk> as well as other more widely published cases <unk> reflecting the <unk> Llives <unk> group's creative activity.
The exhibition will be complemented by Liepaja muzeja.
The visual presentation of the exhibition was in cooperation with the fashion artist and the Taoiseach Elvas Patients.
The musicians who have linked to the group <unk> Llives <unk> and their relatives also referred to the call and shared the subjects and the memory.
The <unk> Llive <unk> was first searched in 1978 <unk> when Liepaja Hurricane is set up in the Sovet Culture House in a quasi-style ansampledge led by Juris Pahtols.
The Ansampled has participated in the festival <unk> Liepaja motars <unk> in 1972 and 1974 <unk> as well as towns and republics.
In 1966 <unk> there was a fatal meeting <unk> when Juris Pahtols took note of the team of the Essaloniki and the Metalurang Culture Committee set up a group calling for the accession of the Ingry Gmant <unk> Andri Krumins
Over the years <unk> the composition of the group has been noticed.

New external strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of the new doctors call for their trade unions to engage in a dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) intends to request the Council to support more extensive protests in early September.
The JAK believes that ministers have failed to dispel any doubt about the treaty.
In July, the new doctors and medical students rejected the contract proposed by LMA.
The contract was voted by 58% of all members of the vote.
On Thursday evening, on Twitter, a member of the JAK Council, the member of the JAK Council, notes that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and that the offer of the treaty has therefore been rejected.
She said: 'In view of this, the JAK vote has led to a complete rejection and decision by the JAK to request new formal negotiations to discuss the key issues. "
In response to the government's silence, the JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize new contracts to come into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors have taken part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
After the vote, which rejected the contract conditions proposed by LMA, which was a recommendation from BMA, to Dr John Malawana, a new foreign member of LMA.
Before a meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had said to members of BPA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the Health Secretary Jant informed that the contract would be concluded with the British medics.
Russia and Turkey: MEPs to vote on a resolution
An obstacle to the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to meet and announce eight months of the end of the war and economic sanctions.
Vladimir Putin, however, commented to the Turkish leader in St Petersburg, to give the impression that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
However, there were two rounds.
Vladimir Putin's smile appeared the closest and did not provoke warm emotion, even in the light of his customary abstention.
In contrast, Mr Erdogan at least five times called Putin about his' dear friend ', a meeting at the front meeting.
I felt the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve before the pre-crisis level, but it will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogans would have fled as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm leads to contradictory feelings.
However, from Putin, the message has shown that Russia's leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing that he mentioned in his speech was to bring Russian aircraft down to the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted sharply at that time.
Putin accused Ankara that it had inspired his back in Moscow.
It was even more painful given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true confidence will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
Since November Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, the government's controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed to be the Turks.
The most serious of the allegations were that the Erdogan's family made a profit from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State controlled by the Islamic State.
He has, of course, denied this, of course.
However, the main message of the St Petersburg Summit is that the time has come to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was only due to the apology of President Erdogan.
Russia could regard this as a kind of victory.
Ankara's benefit from the peace settlement is obvious.
Firstly, the Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failed coup last month in which they tried to overthrow.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There is also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have led to substantial losses, especially the ban on gyarterans, which normally provides every year to a number of millions of Russian tourists in Turkey's inertia.
The number of tourists dropped by almost 90%.
The Russian counterparties and the charter of charter companies are also breastfeeding, when regular flights are to be renovated.
They look forward to holiday in the Mediterranean Sea.
This week, national TV is predicting a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables due to the renewal of imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey.
Nowadays, the local newspaper Vedemocrats quoted: 'Tourism for them, tomatoes us'.
But the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West for, in their view, the weak response to the attempt at the coup.
It is also open to all of the frustration of the long-standing negotiations on EU accession and Putin's intervention, which is happy to use the situation that Turkey is alienated from the West.
The Russian leader has doubtless received additional points in Ankara in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for the elected government after the coup.
Please note that Moscow understands this, because the fear of the regime in the country itself is deeply rooted.
The summit, which took place in the Greze, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as a analyst, the 'excluded alliance', two countries that feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite the unity of the public, there are still considerable differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as peace in peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey are in favour of the opposite.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose information, the two presidents announced that they had not discussed the matter.
The Turkish President had targeted questions on the disagreements of the two countries, while President Putin wished to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries could find common ground on Syria.
However, after months of open hate relations and potential disasters, when a NATO member of NATO shook the Russian battle aircraft, the situation has improved because both leaders at least have reopened negotiations.
A Scottish Royal Bank will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland
The EQS will henceforth have a support role in future, stated the Executive Director of the Bank.
Outside Scotland, there will be no longer access to the SKB.
Ross Macisan tells BBC channel in Scotland that the IRB was associated with bank ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions, because eight years ago, the bank was almost bankrupt and required financial assistance.
In the meantime, the brand behaviour strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with the Union of Six, and finally with Wimbleton Basket Murare.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands to the fore.
The Scottish Royal Bank will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be instigated.
In England and Wales, all the SKB references, beyond the head office and the official exchanges, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There will now be less private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt Military Bank.
The fee was interviewed during a journey with customers and employees in Inverse.
He told BBC Scotland's Cancer: "The SKB will become our investor brand and which our workers are working, as we are now more than a brand bank."
By the time, the bank itself became a global brand and the SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we have no global ambitions any more, we have local ambitions.
Each brand will represent something unique in the sector and our workers will work with customers under these brands.
The SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor the "United Nations" and will involve different brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"The time has come to be a brand bank because we have been asking ourselves for a long time how to become a better bank for its clients?"
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would be an excellent bank for our clients and we will develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs, not our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think that now is the time.
The Frenchman crushed the 3000th victory with the horse Predilection
The motors are corrupt in the championship by making their 3000th win at the finish-fins at the Nizhny Award.
On Friday, the French joy wins his 3000th victory in Britain's history by gaining the first place in the Nizpokevature of Britain.
He reached this by opposing the second victory in these events in his home town, with the Predilection coined by John Gosden.
A 45 year old Italians are the sixth Figer, who has reached a raft of results.
He has joined the Rishard, Dougam Smitry, Lesteram Pigota, Peter Balkensue and Wilson Karmen.
The election champion joke Deters, who won the horse Ghayyyar, said: "This is something specific."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very pleased that this was held in the Nizophrental, because I have been here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not the Royal Askota, but a normal Friday evening with 20 000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
After the victors and the Predilection, we are expecting applause and gathers.
In his career, two fans have reached this record with a step-by-step step-by-step steak of the Champions League with a record number of more than 4 300 wins.
Mr Pigel was the winner in his career as he wrote to 4493 wars during his career.
The Frenchman is one of the times the best of the engines, and it is no surprise that he has achieved a success that only the real one can achieve.
He is sticking and strong, but his tactic is separated from other engines.
He is a fantastic spokesman, his enthusiasm and harasm for years attracting fantasy to this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, I said to the French races that he would have fled to 6 000 victorious if they were not to be in the weekend and the big races.
However, it is a real pleasure, however, that the Frenchman has been regularly watered down by the UK in 30 years.
He is hungry who is perfectly good for the British, and he is an excellent joy.
He noted this achievement with his firm mark: the airworthiness of the air.
For twenty years at the finishing at the end of the finishing wind, the French nurse has been a British horse for twenty years.
This has been a full route.
He has won countless grim rastes, including the famous' great Seventh Researchers' of 1996, Askota, and has survived an aircraft crackdown and the disqualification of preparations.
Three years ago, he had been hard to go back after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated the strength of his nature, challenging those who questioned him in their best form.
And he could take part in the matches for a few more time - it has been said earlier that they would like to continue to take their seats at least up to 50 years old.
Russia's President Putin dismisses his head, Sergei Ivanov, head of administration
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has unexpectedly released the head of the administration, Mr Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the clothes of Putin for many years.
Currently, 63 year-old politician has been appointed as a Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement stated that Putin has "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the Russian President," without mentioning the reason.
Antons Vaino, who has been in office, has been in office since 2012.
The 44 year-old Vaino has been a diplomat.
The Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia's capital Tallinn, absolves the prestigious Moscow State Relations Institute (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As the Kremlin's homepage (in Russian), he later led President's protocol and the administration of government staff.
After appointment, Mr Putin said: 'Thank you for your confidence'.
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the country when drawing up the rules and controlling the execution of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster that Ivanov himself wanted to leave the post and his deputy, who was a substitute for his own office.
Is it persuaded?
This step is confused by Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a sens and a proximity to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, he worked at the Soviet security service to the KGB.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At the public television session, the two men announced that Mr Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But in spite of the smallets of the cameras, it is rare that such an explanation is persuaded, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is it the outcome of the struggle for power?
No one knows.
However, the official assertion that the man, who was considered as a president, suddenly would have liked to be a president of Russia's environmental policy, is treated with great scepticism.
Ivanov, the Kremlin's homepage, tells Putin: 'It is a fact that I am asking me to entrust this difficult post at the beginning of 2012, even to be said, for a difficult post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been working for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service, as well as Putin.
In the end of the 1990s, Putin was headed by the Federal Security Service, which is the successor of VDK, Ivanov.
When Putin came to power, he referred to the number of five people in five people who have confidence in him.
Ivanov, at the end of the second term, was considered as the potential Russian presidential candidate, as Putin's transition to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
But then the President was another close to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister and after three and a half years back to President.
Least fish at a garden in Banfsa
A man in Banfia is asking for assistance to find out the conditions that species have appeared in their garden in Banfia.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish could be a sandwall of a sanctuary.
Mr Beina, who is living around 500 metres from the sea, displayed the Periscope of the fish video, hopeful that someone could know how this 5 centimenets were made in his garden.
Fifth of the wine sector: the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
Today, the €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have been connected to the northern part of the Cvincefarm intersection and viaduke, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts is complete, which means that the building of the bridge is coming to an end.
The structure of Faiff's bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
This consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Today, the €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The Economic Secretary, Kears Brauns, had his seat today and was one of the first to go to the bridge.
He said: 'This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Kvine-farm bridge. "
In this project we are seeing an insurgical technical solution to which only 30 000 tonnes of cementation and steel were used in the construction of this part.
Despite the enormous weight and the size of the bridges, bridges and waves of the bridge is an extremely delicate process that requires an enormous precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the final stage, which will connect the bridge with the Rositu, to be taken today, which means that all the parts of the bridge are ready to be rife.
Michael Martin, director of the fourth bridge project: "The first link is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
The first link in this fantastic project demonstrates the construction of a higher class engineer.
Following the final phase of the installation and the connection of it with the support of the North, we were able to connect the north to the ground, or viaduk.
This was done by paving the north to the south of 700 millimetres from the south.
It was a huge and, at the same time, a very delicate operation.
It is huge, because the viaduke is 222 metres long, weighs around 6 000 tonnes and had to make up around 3% of the bovine animals.
The delicate because the correspondence with which a team was working was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything managed well.
Simona Baillas wins gold exercise for women.
The tension is straightened up.
There is no cause for concern.
It is all undisturbing that the symbol of Simone Bailsu is concerned.
Dynamic indignation.
Between the exercise and the exercise of the exercise, the exercise is fulfilled.
It's not going on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic championship.
In the 19-year-old American Forums, a golden part of the Americans breached the golden medals in a full demonstration between themselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her together, 62,198 was the head of the final court over silver medals and her team at the Alia Mustafins results.
On Thursday, US athlete Simona Baillas carried out a formal rein to the petty fighter fighter fighter fighters in Rio, Brazil, to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Baille became the fourth American consecutive, with the fifth best exercise for the championship and the fifth best exercise in the history of the best exercise, and probably the best exercise in the history of the exercise.
When the end result was announced, she released the tears, as the road to the end was the one at the end.
This achievement brings him to beautiful athletes, such as the Maikl Felps, who lifted his sports at another level.
The past three years have dominated the past three years in the form of a 15 medals in the world's championships, including 10 gold medals, fulfilling such an excellent, precise and ambitious exercise, as the 1984 Olympics Championships were named as "the best exercise that she has ever seen."
In Brazil, he was expected to have seen their last test, where she had to have a great deal of ambition with the expectations of him rather than with the other athletes.
She will be disappointed if she returned to his home in Judgment, the Texas without gold medals.
US athletics Simone Baille (left) and Alija Raismane are surrounded by gold and silver medals in the petty fighter fighter fighter fighter fighter fighter fighter fighter fighter fighter fighters, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medals of Baillas were on Tuesday by making special random coordinators for the Karolans.
Although Bailsa claims that, in his long journey to the wear, it was not true, but it is not true.
Part of her prevalent movement, which includes her special acpodix transition, is accompanied by a Latin music that fits perfectly into the streets next to the Rio Olympics archaic.
It is no coincidence.
The girl, which was adopted by her grandparents when she was still silent and was discovered by the third edition of the KICs in his trip to sport, where the ternary wife took place, it has now become a force to take into account.
She has not lost many of the matches since the summer and a series of winning lines can continue for as long as Bailsa wants.
Although, in the course of the two rotation of Mustafina, it was only an illusion.
The beam and free movement of competitions - the part of competitions, where Bailos will champion the title of the championship - is still in front of us.
She made the headline with 15.433 on the beam and strengthened the leadership with 15.933 on the free movement of movements.
Raising my bread while she expected results, which was a mere formality and his fun in teardstick, when the dream that she had ever recorded in his remarks in his remarks.
The result of the rhetoric was as a slight revenge for four years old when she split the third place with Mustafins but lost the battle for bronze medals.
This time, 22 year-old team captain, which the Americans call 'grandmothers', set out in convincing leadership.
After the performance of the scrap, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to devote the aircraft to the bitter crowds.
In the meantime, 19 year-old Bailos, which was published this week, is now entirely different.
6 years old Mahmoud Brauns survived a peak in Filadelphia.
Police said that the 6 year old bird was shot in Filadelphia, pointing out that it is already the second six-year-old who was shot in Filadelphia this week.
The old CBS Filadelphia news channel confirmed that it was Mahmoud Brauns.
The parents say that Brauns were shot several times, including in the circus, the pot, the roas and the wind, but it was still the consciousness when he was brought to the hospital.
His grandmother's Deloresa Melendeza tells television: 'His baby body was simply a love sadness'.
I cannot believe it.
It has been hospitalised in a hospital and has already suffered several operations.
The family shall be informed that he will certainly recover.
He should have started to go in the first class at local primary school.
Brauns are one of the four people who were in the town of Jermanta in the city of Jermanta.
Three men were also shot: two 29 years old men and one 35-year-old man.
The Canal CBS Filadelphia reported that one in 29 years of age is in a critical state, while the situation of the remaining two is stable.
A child was reportedly found in the front seat of the machinery next to 29 years in a critical state.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police investigate whether some of them were attacked.
The investigating carrier told CBS Filadelphia that it was most likely to be shocked in the shoes.
There were gun patrones of guns belonging to different weapons at the point of the event.
It seems that it has been a long horizon.
There were shell shell on the two sides of the pedestrians.
"It seems to me that there have been several armies here who have taken an active part in the shooting," the Captain Gindivide, the Captain of the Strait of the Filadelphia police.
Several homes and cars were also damaged.
Nobody has yet been detained and it is reported that the police are checking the recording of the observatories.
The shooting was hit with a 6 year old girl in the shots during the shots, while she had played his house in the district of Westbroouti.
She is slowly recovering, while the police are still looking for the perpetrators.
Why do we need a hundred, Gabon and Laurium?
I refer to this as the year of the presence of the Women's Olympic Games in Latin America, for several reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer's Olympic Games since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three militants, Simona Bailsa, Gabine Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, which inspired many young girls.
People can be proud that Alija Ratimane, a team of Jewish and Medyona Kociana, is also part of the Catholic.
Finally, this team is indeed representative of America.
It has also strengthened the participation of the black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, an American American was the best exercise.
Last year, Simona and Gabia took place 1 and 2.
These are impressive results.
Mr Duglash, the previous Olympic champion, became the Olympic championship in the previous Olympic Games, and America was curious.
Now the world has seen unbelievable exercise by the triple world champion, Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Laurium Hernandeza, with unprecedented and methistarious exercise.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American consecutive one, which has obtained a golden part of the individual's many women.
Her team won the silver medal in Alija Raismane.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but in the rest of the country, the situation in the hours of exercise is completely different.
Simona, Gabia and Laurium entered the Olympic sample as the Alliance and Medison.
They are the Olympic Truth, as only four sportspeople will be in the next Olympic exercise, and this is the last year in the third place of the third country in the third country.
In fact, the exercise of exercise is expensive for sport, mainly in private private light clubs, and by parents who pay for training, premises, travel, formasters, hotels (training, sportspeople and their families) and other costs.
Most of these light clubs are located in urban districts that can afford this sport.
The athletes in these clubs are letting all their training work, and this is an expensive and long contribution to light families.
Eimia Burmans, Simper Bailts coach and Megija Hainia, coach and Lauria Hernandez, have trained their athletics since the two girls began to operate with light.
We need to provide young girls inspired by symbols, Gabes and Lauria, cheaper exercise exercises.
I founded my light organisation 20 years ago.
My organisation is located in Heley, and we are offering more than 15 000 towns in cities (mainly black and spanner) exercise, free of charge or at a low price, and we have also traced national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my home city) to ensure that local young people are able to get to know this great sport.
Lowerage is developing forces, covenants and body coordination, as well as hard work, discipline and aspiration to the goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and good results in schools and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to train in miles and it is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this type of sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simona, Alija, Gabonie and Medyon on the excellent demonstration of the 'Football Force', with the golden medals of the Olympic Games and by motivating countless young girls, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After James's offer to reject the offer, the new doctors are planning more strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to disagreements by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with the British Medical Association. However, it was rejected by 58 percent of the 37 000 young doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, the Hant announced plans to conclude a contract, indicating that NHS is in a precarious position and that further delay would only be to the detriment of employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new treaty to change the conditions for night work and weekends to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Last night, BMA's new doctor, Dr Elna Macourta, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular, that it will deepen the labour crisis and does not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks before the first new doctor will sign the new treaty, it is necessary to make progress, as there is not much time left.
BMA efforts to solve the problem of negotiations have faced the government's unwillingness to get involved and sometimes with complete silence.
This has happened despite the fact that last month, James Hant said that his doors were always open.
The gesture Hant must act immediately, put an end to inaction and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
At the end of April, more than 13 000 rutine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, while the nurses and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had gone into piquette.
Ministers hoped to put an end to disagreements by reaching agreement on a treaty change with the British Medical Association.
BMA would like to raise the rate of work weekends in 54 000 new doctors to be covered by new contracts.
The Chief Executive of NHS, Mr Daniels Moriter, called on the young doctors to take industrial action.
Mr Mortimera said that strikes do not solve anything, but only increases pressure on businesspeople and worries, creates stress and hindrances for patients, carers and their families.
We have spoken with the new foreign committee for the last two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about the borrowers and whistleblowers.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues, such as the deployment of staff, flexible training, additional training for those returning to career breaks, training costs, training curricula, the abandonment of studies and gender pay inequalities in medicine, shows that employers, the British health education institutions and the Health Ministry seriously want to reach an agreement with BME in November, February and May.
Medical medicines can reduce the risks of heart of the 2 pounds day.
Thousands of patients who have been very heart could be treated with a medicine by 2 pounds per day because official representatives make recommendations on more people and longer periods.
The recreation medicine, Ticagrelor reduces the risk of abundance for people at heart.
This medicinal product is already being used for use 12 months after the heart of heart.
The NICE will comment on using this preparation 4 years after the heart of the NICE in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems to people with cardiovascular problems.
However, at the moment, NICE in charge of NHS is under way to use this preparation 4 years after the heart of this preparation to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular and cardiovascular risks.
Every year around 140 000 people in England are going through a heart and a quarter of them are going through a repeat or insula.
The hubs and the insurers are caused by the accumulation of fat in cardiovascular walls, in the form of dientations.
If I break it, it could lead to thrombolism by blocking blood stretches to a heart and a heart attack.
However, if the thrombin is discarded from blogs, it can get further blood pressure and to block blood access to the brain, causing infarctic.
People who have been very heart are at greater heart of conspiracy.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British firm AstraZeneca, traded with the name Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombolism.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend to people to use 90 mg Ticagrelor 12 months and 3 mg twice a day together with aspirin.
According to Professor Kerola Longson, the NICE Health Technology Director: "Despite the fact that medics have access to the redemption, more than a quarter of people who have had their generosity are going through yet another cruel or insula, which often has severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart can have a negative impact on the quality of life of the individual.
Evidence shows that Ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, effectively reduces the risk of repetitive and infarial risk to people who once experienced it.
By profoundly recommending treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we can extend the possibilities for treatment for thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of assimilation for longer than three years, the draft guidelines do not make a recommendation to use it for longer than three years.
Policing culture contributes to fraud during electoral fraud in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former mayor of the town of Economy, Lutfurs Rahman, was dismissed in terms of corruption.
The Government's report reveals that, as a result of political correctness, the culture of political correctness has led to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Ethics criticises police, electoral supervisors and the cities that ignore the signs of fraud during the electoral process, as "fear to prejudice the ethnic and religious interests."
The former Secretary of the Communities, who has now become an anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards at election stations to protect the intimidates.
He also suggests that the electorate should produce a supporting document when they vote to prove their true identity.
Only the name and address of the votes should now be indicated by the voters.
He even recommends that the purchase of voters' votes in favour of double voting should be marked.
They also need to provide more protection, say Sir Merkel.
He considers that the press should have greater access to documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local authorities from more corruption and fraudulent fraud, which go hand in hand with it'.
The report was commissioned by Dauningstrich following the scandal of the elections for the city.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to lift the mayor of the city of Lutfurt Rahman from the mayor of the mayor of Lutfurt Rahman from the mayor of the city.
The Court found the Rahman "was cynically distorted" of the religious vision of its Muslim community and concealed its critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign to the effect that the religious responsibility of the religious Muslims is to vote in favour."
Some 300 votes were falsified or doubtful as one person had voted on several occasions.
Sir Eric also shows signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that fraud would be particularly worrying, in which the oldest members of the Muslim communities have forced others to vote in favour of candidates for their preferred candidates.
Sir Merkel recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the identity of the person, to find a person's identity.
His report shows, 'Evidence shows that the vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, are forced to vote on the candidates for the older candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan. "
"There is concern that the areas of the areas are not attentive to these problems because of political correctness, as they could be affected by ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Merkel set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to deal with mail order to prevent "votes."
The report, which is considered by the Territa Meja, also calls for more thorough checks to be carried out in order to prevent the use of voter lists in the area of immigration and benefits.

He was plaguly found guilty of criminal criminal evidence based on insurmountable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient screenings of the voters of the city council.
Sir Merkel says: "The court ruling in last year is a wake-up call.
Our land is known as the homeland of parliament, but the worrying and disguised spread of the electoral fraud and the likes of the authorities that fraud is not a threat to this good repute.

On the CBC Olympic Games, he apologists for his comment that the Chinese grey was dead as pigs.
The Bairona Makdonalda's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhas at the fourth place of Ai Yanhas at 4x200 in the 4x200 m lestile stays for women, was convened in the CBC spectators at the fourth place.
The Canadian Canal CBC was forced to apologise, as one of its commentators commented that 14 years old Chinese swimming from the competition was "flying from the race to the race, that the smird" and "end up like pigs."
Commenner Bairone Makdonalds thought his microphone had been expelled when the women of 4x200 mill women were finalising their personal opinion at the end of the finals.
The magazine, who was included in the team of the CBC, to make comments on life, said: "It's a small fourteenth birthday from China to keep with it."
"I have gone too much, she was out of the rifles, that they were ridiculed and ended like pigs."
Thank you very much.
A 14-year-old Chinese Assistant Assister Ai Yanghhana was 1: 57.79, 1.61 seconds cheaper than the result of Tilores Rucks, allowing China to do so.
The visitors throughout Canada have responded promptly to the internet because they were shocked to hear such tones and expressions.
Emets Makfarlain write on Twitter: "Do you direct the CBC comment just now that the 14th anniversary of China's" outlet was not like pigs?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
It did not understand that they were still in direct eating.
Ai Yanha from China's 4x200m lethal phrase for women was described as "the small fourteenth anniversary of China that is not there."
Criticism of Bairona Makdonalina was rapidly adopted because many asked for clarification.
On Twitter, Twitter was unable to believe, hearing the outrage of Bairona Mcdonalda.
On Twitter: Oho, #ByronMacDonald.
For the CBC and Canada, and because of the tests that have been made, we all sound as a racist.
After that, Scotland, which led to the CBC live audience at the time, apologised for the comments made by Makdonalda, saying: 'We apologise for the comment on the result of the swimming result in the direct eur. "
This was a missed choice of words and it is a great pity that this was the case.
The CBC has apologised to over 90 people who had reacted on Twitter.
He had to apologise to his colleague, Scotland, at his place.
There was then an apology from CBC to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comment.
The canal was also quickly released by an apology and a statement.
We very much regret the fact that such comments were made and they were in direct eur.
Yesterday, we immediately reacted and apologised to all the direct viewers and followers of the social media.
For reasons of clarity, the Bairona comments were expressed as a floating performance rather than addressed to her personally.
But, in any case, they were unprofessionally and unsuccessful in terms of statements of expression and fear.
On Thursday afternoon, the madonman in person apologised directly and tried to explain that he was not thinking that his comment would be taken as a personal attack.
He said at the CBC Olympics live: "I would like to use a moment and apologise for a comment that I said yesterday after the empowerment of women."
I am talking about a floating performance, not for him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to show a disrespect and I very much regret that this was the case.
They are shocked by a woman shooting a woman who is unashamed in the midst of a subsistant subcontractor.
They felt uncomfortable when a woman started to dress in order to run a bonus in the middle of a bonus.
To further deteriorate the situation, the situation he had made to check whether they stand for her and then shut down, putting their bikes back on the shelves.
She went on to look for the apparel Folkestonas Bouverie Place and four other bikes.
The guest for the Bouverie Place at the Centre for Trade - a place where this woman took a subwear and then put it back on the shelves.
Meanwhile, two children of children in the shop were also in the store, John Nividson, who tells me that the unknown woman after the subpoisoned filling his clothes and abandoned a shop will not be burdened.
She points out that people were unable to believe their eyes.
In the midst of a helpless, she took the subbicycle and blowed his straits and blank and wear their peers on the ground.
She did not even try to find a more sensitive place where it was to be measured.
Everyone looked at how his bicycle and apparently they did not like it, because she was simply pushed back on the shelves.
She wrote three other bikes until he decided that she did not like to like a shop and abandoned the shop.
It did not seem to worry that someone looked at a man who bought his biscites that she is going.
Daysisonme jaunkundze (33 years) from Kenya: "I see the idea that someone bought a bunker that has been blowed by another person and which has not been washed afterwards."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
"I assume that, after her departure, the workers made out the clothes from the shelves from the shelves - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that it could buy a new subdivision and find out that another woman has lent to and then failed to dishibit them.
The spokesman pointed out that Primark is aware of the incident which took place on Tuesday 9 August.
The particular clothes have been taken out of the shelves.
How to protect themselves from firearms through Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in a distance from the attackers with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga's magnitude from New York Misraki.
Regardless of whether you are attacked on the front or back, this video shows how to protect and to prevail over the attackery.
The mines indicate that if the attacker is attacked on the back, it is necessary, first of all, to get back to a clear eye and to avoid the current trajectory.
Then the weapon must be struck between his front hand and shoulder and the entine in the face with his free elite.
Then there is a blow down the knee and while the attacker is painted, he must take his arm out of his arm and take up his arm at the time of his or her weapon and back the weapon by continuing to pursue a weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching from the front, the situation is similar - we need to avoid the stone trajectory, to meet the weapon and take it out so that the evil is impossible to shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be exerted on a weapon and a wake-up call and finally take his arm and give him a chance to continue to do so.
It is difficult?
You look at the video to see exactly how it is done in mines.
But it will be remembered if you are not Krav Maga's master, then it is safer to give the looting out of his money.
The family of Vandoli, the family of Salta Cornvolas, is being put to the streets.
The family of Vandinners is out of residence for terrorising the neighbours, causing damage to the social mother at 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner, Šons Trebilkok, have been hindered from property in Salta Cornvola due to a number of complaints submitted to them.
When they were forcibly removed from property, the shoot poll found that property was completely demolished.
The waves were beaten and the wall had flowed through the wall and the wall had been buried by grafiti.
The family is now out of property and is most likely to be in private ownership.
Donna Makevoja, the manager of the Housing Service, says that there is concern that housing will not be restored.
She tells us that the people who have lived here have been extremely difficult and they believe that people cannot live it.
Several factors need to be assessed in this case, since in the future there will be no good repute for this property.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The others have had three sons that were periodically hosting their property and the police say that their terror was perpetrated as violence, abetting on the streets of Beyball, the intimidation of the local population, the drug use, the sale of drugs, and looming and booming.
For 47 years, the old Skeldone, which was the property of his name, was punished for anti-social behaviour in June.
Multi-demolished trailers found their waste.
In the home where the drugs were previously possible, there have been several degrees of grandson.
Neighbours say that they are regularly featured on the street and were constantly being called police.
The Koran Housing Service has been forced on them from the coercion when they had been given 11 weeks to choose from their homes on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbours were very happy to eat, because their life was zero.
One said: 'They did not care for other citizens'.
We were living with them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It is unbelievable how often we have seen the police here.
I could not sleep this morning.
We wake up, because we were so silent here - we are not used to it!
Now that they are finally away, it will be wonderful here.
Adams Fitzpatrik, who is the Head of the Neighbourhood Protection Officer of Cornvolas, said that the family did not cooperate with the local safety authorities.
The family has been here for 20 years and is regularly called police.
Various old and unworkable objects were found in the garden garden in the garden.
He also said: 'It is a great pity that the Irish did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because eating from the home is always the last step taken by the Corsovola Housing Service. "
This was a very difficult occasion, because their behaviour was extreme and that the neighbours were very hard to wear their behaviour very hard.
I appreciate the work that has been done on this dossier by the entire team of my team, the Devon and Cornvolas and the members of the compartment who were courageous and collaborating with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make the lives of our neighbours easier and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrtick said that all of the three sons have lived in different time periods, but all of you are around 20 years old.
It's not a clean hair that has left the floor in one of the room after his eviction.
The staff of the service will now have to meet the waste room that left the house.
In 2014, the police were carrying out searches and more than 70 grams of cannabis, weightings, accessories and 1700 pounds cash.
It was only recognised as guilty B for the storage of narcotic drugs with a view to distributing them.
She insisted that the money was set to be a monument to her son in Los Schelson, who died in the car accident in 2013.
After the shooting it has become known that they are currently renting a private property in Plimuta.
A lot of houses were picked up in grafiti.
Police states that they will continue to pull the Irish who violate their rental contracts.
The leftist and Cornvolas police, Andor, indicate that this edition is a clear warning for other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said: "This is a warning to those who believe that they can and will have no consequences."
There is no acceptable criminal and anti-social behaviour to the police and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
The ability to spend the money on the economy can help.

Cannes has banned burkes swimming on the beaches.
The French mayor of the French town of Cannes, the Mayor of Cannes, has banned the wear swaps of this town on the beaches of this city, which almost completely covers the woman's body and is very reminiscent of the hydrochery, the local officials said on Thursday.
The Mayor of Cannes, Denmark, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is forbidden for anyone who does not have a bathing water that respects good customs and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Punside spending, which is exorbitant to religious affiliation, when France and the cult are the target of terrorist attacks, can lead to a disruption of the public order (druldling, collision etc.) which needs to be prevented," the order said.
"We are not talking about banning the wear of religious symbols on the beaches, but about the external clothes associated with confidence in terrorist movements that are carved with us," said Miguel Arias.
He added that the burkes were not seen at the Cannes beaches since 28 July, when a member of the centre-right member Linguine signed the order and entered into force.

On 26 July, the two attaches who had opened their confidence in the Islamic State were brutally murdered in the church in the north-west of France.

The Lucavsala has begun a festival in Cuba.
On Thursday, 11 August, the launch of the European Parliament will be held on Thursday, 11 August.
On the first night, groups like Enter Shikari have been lured by the British, which was expected last year, but not missing, the American panic "NOFX," DJ Maxim from The Prodicgy and others.
At the next festival, the programme also takes heed note of the words' Guano Hees' and 'Garbitage', the 'Ramon Ramon Ramon', Marky Ramone's BlitzRussig, 'Brutto & Lyapis', with the Belarusian pancy, Sergei Mihaloks, the populous sink, the Vopli Vidoplyasova, and a number of others, but a whole range of other, but full measure, can be considered here.
This is the second year in which the festival 'Kubana' is taking place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not deter the organiser from repeated attempts: the name added to the title, including a Latvian group (19: 15 on Friday night, 15 to the spectates' All Day Long ') and announced that the festival has now been "the nearest and won local flask alongside the Riga symbols such as its panorama and cats."
Will these efforts be justified, it is too early to judge, because the festival was only stuck, but, as the 'Delfi Outside' observed in the first night, at least for the time being, the huge efforts made by the people have not been ascertained and the number of visitors was similar as last year.

President, who was in the shadow: Gustavam 145.
On Friday 12 August, marks the 145 years since the birth of the second Latvian state Gustav Low.
The Latvian state was proclaimed Latvian state, but did not earn the first time in the shadow of the first President of the Republic of Latvia in the shadow of President Ulmask.
None of our statesmen have so strongly defended democracy and the rule of law as the Loan, 10 years ago Gustavich, the Gustavich Earth, to write the Arnoins Auzins.
Delfi's Auzins speech highlights the Low to be one of the top senior politicians who have had a sense of humour.
The rest are stoned, always very correct.
He taught this at all, it might be like the Raimonds Vejonis.
"He was close to the people," he said.
Today's politicians are poorly aware of history, they referred to the Kārli Ulman as good leader, but rarely know how unbearable he was.
The only person to sit in the IGC was General Voodis.
Even if in the bills, he is kind and smile, he was a hysterical one after nature.
"The earth with his humour and democratic leaves exactly the opposite impression," said Auzins.
The Professor Aivars Stranga, University of University History and philosophy of philosophy, Aivars Stranga, in a conversation with Delfi, agrees to Ask's assessment of the Earth as a peaceful and measured statesman.
He also notes that the Earth's tribute to the minorities was regularly called on by Jewish representatives to the President's pile.
"At the time, it was not customary," the historian historian said.
He was a quiet and weighed man for his time to become president.
He did not aspire to him, simply for the mask.
He also valued himself rather critically because it did not know the French language, but it was thought that the President would certainly be able to understand it.
"At the time of the Presidency, the French fouls of the French language were both studied," Stranga said.
The earth was not in any way enough to stand as a candidate, he did not like it at all.
In every respect, he has a very dignified personality in the history of Latvia, before being in the head of the president - he was very demanding.
It was led by the famous Earth, the famous Earth in the streets of Suvorova, where the Latvian state was located at the Latvian state.
He was always progressive.
There was not a great eat of the Ulster, but he did not object to the public.
"In the private negotiations, it is sometimes the case that the activities of the Ulmacle were not synonymous with him," Strang said.
They lived peacefully, have no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
What does the Earth remember today?
It is a shame, but for a large part of he, he associated himself with a street in Riga.
He was central to the House.
"She did not have any major turmoil at his time, i.e. he could be associated with a true stable presidency," Strang Stranga.
Gustava Earth, a Latvian state visit to Sweden, which was indirectly meant to be fully recognised as a neighbour to Latvia during the period from 1927 to 1930.
On 28 May 1929, a country has arrived in Stockholm on the earth.
The reply visit to Latvia by the Swedish King Gustava took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president was born in 1871, but it was in January 1939.
Simply ways of helping the child cope with anger inefficiencies.
I am often faced with the fact that the anger of the baby, the Nazis is considered something wrong and abnormal.
When the child reveals its anger - we do not know how to react, Econet indicates psychoe Jekateness Kesa.
Specialist encourages a small round of talks on these natural and human beings - the anger and the nikty that everyone is going through periodically.
Agreia - it is already physical activity addressed to another person, and it is usually emerging when we feel angry.
When we, adults, we are angry, alarmed - usually we know what is happening with us and how to deal with it.
We can, our anger and the nation in our face: to express, suppress, hide, to keep your friends or other relatives, we can be frightened by your friends or other relatives, we can blew on the strange, to praise the cigarette (it is not the best way to disperse!), go in a dozen thread and do other things that are usually not practised.
We are not targeting others, because we know various other ways to deal with these emotions.
Children when they are looking for anger do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say 'Ej away', you're a fool, '"I don't see you," I don't see you, "I don't see you."
Children are literally living in a literal sense, they are entirely here, at this point in time, they are spontaneous and genuinely in their feelings, and often are also in various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid their feelings, including anger, not ashamed of it and not in the wrong, but on the contrary, to help the child.
Is the relationship needed?
A long working day, in which everything has not been going on as you would like, or simply a bad tone, is so many reasons why I would like to take a moment, day or even longer, to a day out of the world.
Can I also like to read the relationship for a moment, and it would be possible to breathe a little?
Or is it also the case, though, that each of its partners should be able to eat?
I share the views that have been expressed in the various midwives.
Janis (23) is a brief and concise: "In my view, if the relationship needs to be accompanied, then you do not be with the real people."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has opened a scheme which may help anyone.
If you feel that the partner is starting to cry for a nerve for every small detail, then it is certainly the right moment to look at other hunting fields to understand whether you are missing or not to see him any more.
So the answer is yes, it can save time and understand how important you have to be the second half.
Kaspars (29) reveals theory.
In my view, the relationship has to be filled on each other's daily life, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that I am going on every detail that the other is doing, and it is starting to fall on the nervous.
People are starting to shut each other, especially when it is not even more to talk about what you did by day.
My personal experience suggests that I have not passed a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think about the fact that, elsewhere or in the other, it is better - why this woman, with whom you are together, deserves to be able to think that there is little enough here and behind the mountain?
Thoring alone is already low.
There is no case.
"I have it, so I am a little punishment for those who do not," said Mr Edmunds (46).
(33) I have a completely different opinion to you (33).
It seems to me to be in a moment of time.
You won't be every minute, all the time, from the morning to the dinner to look at each other in the eye and stifle any love love.
About!
There are so many things - friends, work, ballots.
We all have some time.
Of course, friend or wife, too, however, if they are both aware of the balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the grass side.
It is only so.
The word (27) is so: "It is hard to say, need or not, or not to take it on board, but one thing is clear: there is no room for the table before the end, something missing."
If this question is raised, then there will be some changes in the near future - good or bad - that depends on the same thing.
I think, as long as you are still new and crazy, you need to need to be taken all the time, but when things go seriously and do things in another phase, then there can be no talk of rest.
You decide to spend all our lives together.
"If you are not able to withstand each other now and then have to be breastfeeding, then what will happen when you are going to be pensioners who comment on how spirituous cats have to worry or argue about where the day is much better to worry," Kristaps (19) explained.
All Mr names have changed.
Through my enthusiasm and enthusiasm, the Rozenium first wasn't attracting an interest to the art arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the people of Latin America, which will remain unformable," said Roman Suta, the old-birthday of the Latvian gene.
In 2016, the Latvian National Army Museum in the main building is clear: the Latvian National Army Museum is clear: there is a first love of the Latvian art of art.
The exhibition opened on 12 August, but it is available to visitors from 13 August to 30 October.
The Latvian National Army Museum, with a wide retrospection in the newly opened UPR, hones gleznorer Jani Rozental (1866-1916), one hundred and fiftieth births at international level, to be held at the International Day of the celebratory Day of UNESCO.

In the event that her candidacy was approved in the government, it is clear that it would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow for the necessary changes to be made to the Revenue Service, with the support of all the government.

The RAC has put in place all over the total five State Control (VPA) recommendations on the development of a project on the island of Russian salt port activities from the city centre, the portal was informed by the Portuguese authorities.
The project is scheduled for the forthcoming meeting of the Management Board of the Management Board of Riga.
In order to be able to implement the recommendations in line with the ECK, when preparing recommendations for the implementation of the recommendations, the managing body of the Riga Free Ports was also guided by the conclusions and recommendations of the legal and operational audit by the International audience for improving the management of the project at the next stage of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations today is also sent to the VK.
Despite the fact that the Managing Government in Riga does not agree with the opinion of the VP on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the funding provider (EC).
I would like to underline that all the planned works within the project are fully completed within the set deadlines and planned.
"In order to prove all involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the ECC and also to the stimulation that the main objective of the free port is to implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the ECC on the management and monitoring of the project," said Sanita Kaire, the head of the Russian island.
The monitoring and monitoring of progress made towards achieving the project's target for monitoring and monitoring of the long term action plan was complemented by the key actions planned by the parties and the necessary time-frames, timescales and timescales, timeframes for the monitoring of the construction process, as well as the definition of major thresholds.
The agreed action plan to achieve the objective of the project until 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the EQF, is complemented by enforcement monitoring activities, thereby reinforcing the duration of the other parties involved in the project's implementation.
The development of project management and the reduction of potential risks from a new nature have been developed with a draft management plan defining the management areas of the project and identifying the documents developed to ensure the control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
The project's management structure has been developed, reflecting the structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of its staff.

German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to new studies, the number of fatalities in the Jet miles at the time of the former East Germany could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims remain unaddressed.
According to the data recorded on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall wall at Checkpoint Charlie, from 1945 to 1989 at the border with the western ally, and the later Western Communist authorities murdered 1841 people who have tried to escape their territory from their territory.
The museum with border fatalities has been studied for years and corrected by every time the number of victims.
A further 11 fatalities are added to the list this year, including including victims of a six-year-old boy drowning, trying to reach the family through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet Armed Forces.
"The final damage caused by the evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," he said.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died in trying to escape from the Communist state-controlled country would be serviced and not disappeared."
However, the new figures have already been questioned by other researchers.
The Süddeutsche Zeitung said in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, an expert in the Berlin Free University in Berlin.
He is currently revising suspected cases of death at the border with other researchers in Berlin, and so far only 260 cases were approved.
In the past, researchers estimated only to the Berlin Wall murdered 138 people by the communists.
In view of those who have died in trying to flee the Baltic Sea or get to the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, the number of victims could, in this view, be around a thousand.
However, this is still far less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the various victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also counts all suicides in the East Germany border guard, whether directly related to their services.
The museum also counts the deaths that are not related to direct violence.
"If the old-age of 70 to 80 years after the borderline control has died from a heart," it should be the consequences of this' murderous border '.
It is, however, convinced that the distinction needs to be made between the elderly people who may have died as a result of the bypassing of their experience and those whose death is caused by a long-lasting waiting period at the time of the hot.
Regardless of the accounts of the victims, it is not easy because the authorities of the communist East Germans did not accumulate such statistics, and that researchers must take up documents in different archives of the traded archives.
However, this group has recently made new documents available and therefore, in the near future, it could come up with a new estimate of the number of victims.
LPF President Pone to Rio Team is surprising; it is surprising.
In the last few days, the notorious teamwork of the Latvian Pelder Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone at the Rio Olympics, came to the Olympic Games, but it is amazed to be surprised.
On Wednesday the Olympic athleg coach Germans Jakubovska said that he had to go home at the latest in Rio de Janeiro.
The initial list of drivers was approved by Assistant Al Ribakova and Uvis Kalnins, coach Jakubovsky and Deivs Kolins, as well as federation President Pone.
The Latvian Federation of Pelder has joined the Olympic Games, and Mr Vrublewicz said before the departure Aldon Vrublevieja that Germans would be and he is looking for tickets.
"However, apparently, for objective reasons he was not," Pone said he did not affect the outcome of Ribaco.
He took her help at the federation's request.
Pone who himself is a member of the Executive Committee of LOK, strongly criticised the activities of the LOK, leading to the blame on the Olympic sport monitoring organisation.
In my view, it is unethical for the Executive Committee to confirm five persons and one of them unethical.
"I don't know why it was not the Pelding Federation," the Pone said that the Society had no value in terms of federations and their presidents, recalling that there is no salary for the Presidents of the Federation.
Ms Pone was criticised by Jakubovski, who said before the London Olympics, when Ribakov was not approved as a member of the International Water Sports Federation (FINA), and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
He was not able to tell me why he was in the Olympic Games with a training accreditation that was most likely to be due to Jakubovsky.
"I was submitted as a federation president (team leader), but for unknown reasons, I received a training accreditation and now did not go in the home."
The situation changed every day, the number of accredited accreditation changed.
Until the last moment, I think that Germans would be, because the other information did not have me.
According to the information at the disposal of the Agency, a couple of days before the Ribakov, she had been speaking against his eyes to the eye with the Poni, and after he was asardued in the eye, the President himself said that it was a daily conversation with a desire for athletes before the start.
The LPF recalled that the LPF is monitoring five types of sports that are in the Olympic programme, and in four of them training children also take place in Latvia.
The President of the Federation commented that it was also very important for the drowning issue, and also for programmes for such programmes, for almost two weeks now.
He praised the federation work and said that in 2018, Latvia could deal with the World Cup phase.
In Rio de Janeiro, there is no leave, I am working on my time, spent my time and trying to carry out the four-year programme.

Every year, the formation and numerical extent of the juvenile and legant species in Daugava and its bicycle in Daugava and its bicycle shall be carried out.
The propagation of fish resources in Daugava and its basin of watercourses shall be carried out by Bior on the basis of the economic activities caused by the economic activities of Latvia and by a conclusion on the compensation measures to be made in order to ensure the diversity of fishery resources.
The National Environmental Service, on the basis of the expertise, shall, on the basis of this expertise, decide on the level and nature of the compensation.
Latvia's energy recovery plan amounts to €1.035 000 for the recovery of fish resources.
In the spring of 2016, Latvia is deploying 400 artificial fish spawning, in conjunction with the Society, in Daugava on the fifth year.
Cooperation with members in promoting the natural spawning of fish is Latvia, in addition to support the initiative within the framework of the recovery of fish resources.
It is a major step forward that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish stocks in Daugava.

The French court rejects the requirement to dismantle the shops in the 'Jungle' refugee camp.
The French court rejected the request by the French authorities to dismantle dozens of self-set shops and restaurants in the 'Jungle' camp where several thousand refugees live.
At the hearing in Calais on Wednesday, the authorities said that the country would have to confuse 72 self-set shops where people sell different goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, to cover up to 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro in restaurants.
Calais the Prefect Office indicated that these self-created companies should be demolished, as they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as the risks of fires and sanitation.

They also pointed out that self-set shops and restaurants are often offered free shelter and food for those most in need.
The Lille court ruled that there is no legal basis to expel people who have created 72 self-set shops, but it understands the prefects of Calais Prefect.

Fiji was impressed by the masses by rebuilding the way in which British force was used for fun.
For the Kapteinim Tomam Micht and MPs, it was like a break with several travelling buses and the World Short Championships at the top 5: 0 when Osea Kolinisau won the first destination.
In the last four minutes, Jerma Tuwai also increased the overweight to the right-wing side.
The result 12: 0 and the British team had not actually touched the bomb.
MiGyela's magnificent mode of power did not let Leoni Nakaravy wrote three points, but it was only a little influenced by Fiji's result.
Jasa Vereachua scored up in the seventh minute on the edge of the game by strengthening the dominance of Great Britain to 17: 0.
After the game, the Nakarava was further scaled up until the end of the first half... at the end of the first half.
Mr Ravouvou avoided some of the awful British force methods and crossed the line.
The aim was 29: 0.
Fiji were born to play rum rhetor-7, while the British are only learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team has made a fundamental change at midday by shifting Fiji's guns... the full four minutes that were good after the first half of the season, until the fantastic teenagers win a few more points for Fiji's team.
Denam Norwear managed to win a point for the British team in his left-wing corner and to achieve a 36 result: 7, but the game had already lost, and the Champions were singing in the meantime, waved flags and deluded in the tribins.
There is no admiration for Fiji's lives.
Mata Viliame made Fiji a further sweet in the end of the game.
As I came to the end of the game, Fiji could start to celebrate, but the British were able to sit in theft after defeat.
In the first half of the day in Fiji, Fiji delivered 20: 5, while the British were over to South Africa, where the two teams lost only a few points.
At the first half of half, Kail Brauns made a Bok team at the top of the team, while at the second half, Dens Norwear crossed the line with a brighter line and took a bumen between the masses, giving the brothers a victory.
Mark Vatanen, who is the teenager of England's Rhic regiment, the great strength of power at the end of the game, secured a team win and another silver medal.
The Trenner's fight against cancer was inspired by the Helny Glover and Heteri Staning in airstrikes.
This will be a golden part of the golden part of these laws, and that is a great deal.
Estacio da Lagoza de Lagoza, a golden gold of Estacio da Lagoza, has been very important for the first time since the first storm, the Hellenic Glovet and Heteres Staningas was in Lagoza.
Although the boat is only the two sportspeople, they spent the Robin Vilpasa, who inspired up to the second Olympic gold medals to rerouble to women, becoming the first women in the history of the British sport, which has achieved this success.
They did not hesitate to prevail because, for 39, they did not have a clear, unprecedented victory.
The two superficial athletes of the bed with the bed of the surface of the bed, completely do not reflect this triumph.
Out of each gold medals, there is a whole team that is working hard to continuously improve the performance of athletes and contributed to their success in their success, who did not know the day before 30 months ago, because he was found to be a cancer.
After what he said, it disappeared just as fast as it appeared.
I was a urb cancer that is one of those who can and has also been operational.
If not, it would circulate in the whole body.
And the situation would be uncontrolled.
It changes your vision a bit.
Counterfeiting is detected in December 2013.
This trio has made it possible to launch a recovery procedure at the beginning of 2014 in the early season and to reduce the length of the break to a minimum if it can be said.
I had a need for income, which is why I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated the recovery.
I was in a hospital and I went to 6, 10 and even 15 metres long distances, even though the doctor said that some steps would be enough.
All of this started.
Airing is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even higher.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately on the Vilciens, who had been very disturbed by all the morning and the worry was more than usual.
A Standing, which has been at the Royal Artillery Union in Afghanistan, said: "This was an emotionally difficult week, but that means a great deal."
This only confirms how much it means and how much I, Helena and Robin, have been working on.
The 3 years of GMO and Robin Robin have been excellent.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better coach member or better traineeships.
Helena Glovere and Hetere Standing in the five years have not lost some of the races.
It is reaching as enormous speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 daughters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to get closer, Stanings and Glowear were too high.
We felt every minute.
The Helena knew: 'Keep the wheel, preserve the wheel'.
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We managed to get a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On the same day, we did not have the intention to overthrow record, but simply to make rock and to win the race and that we did.
The rest of the year will be rested to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the star of the Glover and television adventure.
In the meantime, she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
This would have been too pressure.
In London, I needed around six months to understand that I am the Olympic chamber.
This was a new experience and I was very alarmed.
This time it took around four minutes.
She said: 'it is fantastic'.
The unique opportunity is to look at the fantastic architectures of the Central Biblik.
King more about the Central Library of the City of Central California, as members of the Architecture Architecture, meet in Arnosis's Central Bibliotka: Its League of Architectural History and Architectural History has been held in Arnosis Jull.

Mixed and omulous bloodlands are going through domestic changes,
Coup to Los Angeles's Central Liverpool's 50-year-old Bibliotbuildings - with whom another? - as a new book!
Kolegova's Head of Secretary of VD will "be driven to the last."
According to him, now the Minister for the Greens / Farmers (Greens / Farmers) and Minister for Finance, Danai Kuchinskim (Greens / Farmers), are already "principally important" for the appointment of the Finance Minister to the head of the Revenue Service.
Rajevskis knew that both Kuchinskim and Reizhny Ozig are "the first big decision" to influence him as a political future.
If the position of the head of the Revenue Service will now start to change, it will have a negative effect on their own administration.
The session of the Cabinet of Ministers for the next week includes the issue of the transfer of VVD Kolegova to the Director-General of the Revenue Service, according to the government agenda.
Kolegova chaired Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola, after the resignation of Inar Peter Peterson, and when the competition to the post of Director-General of the Revenue Service ended, without the result.
On Thursday, on 11 August, he was able to agree with Latvian Radio on Thursday on Thursday, 11 August.
The Finance Minister later admitted that no other candidates for the Revenue Service will be dealt with at the time.
Raivus Dzintars, head of the Saeima National Alliance, said that the King was still in favour of Kolegova's leadership.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the deficit is jeopardised by the failure to set up a government.
A month ago on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal did not take sufficient steps to reduce their deficit levels to 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the euro area.
It is estimated that despite the austerity measures in place in the end of last year, the deficit in Portugal was 4. 4% of GDP and 5. 1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries, but at the same time to set fiscal targets for the immediate period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Accompanying sanctions would only increase this negative message.
Critics suggest that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on uniform rules and then unable to apply them to life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, has indicated that Europe is losing confidence in this way, creating the impression that the rules of the European Union are recommendation, rather than binding.
Now the EC has proposed and all Member States have approved extending the deadline for the adjustment of the budget deficit by the end of this year to Portugal and until 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission is promising to examine the progress made by both countries in the next few months while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be ready to introduce additional austerity measures if the circumstances so require.
Original forecasts suggest that Portugal's objective could be reached within the deadline and could already fall to 2. 5% of gross domestic product this year.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government needs to implement the austerity measures of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget with a further focus on controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the deficit must be reduced to 4. 6%, next year to 3. 1% and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, in the next two years consolidation measures should be 0. 5% of GDP every year.
In particular, it makes it difficult to achieve these objectives that, for eight months now, the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government, and there is an increasing possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls show that third elections will also substantially change the political landscape in the country.
The popular party still has a popular party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rahoja, who will win less than 33% of votes again.
It is only the socialists, while the austerity measures in the 'Podemos' or 'Together we can' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos' or 'Ciudadanos'
The People's Party wants to get involved with socialist and Ciudadians in government this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval of the 2017 draft budget by mid-October.
As announced by the parliamentary faction of the People's Party, Rafah Hernando, if the government did not succeed and parliamentary elections will still be organised for the third time, Spain will become a panacea for Europe.
The purity of smoke in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
Fifth years after beaches, activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of landlocked waste is, unfortunately, an increase in the number of landfills and mostly bathing sites.
The most polluting bathing sites are directly in Riga.
The Capital Domain said that bathing sites would be copied daily, but the fight against the dirty visitors is rather difficult.
In addition, the land left in the land may be scrapped into the water during torrential rain, which will greatly damage its quality.
In the case of Liepaja beaches and certain places in Kurzeme, beachs in other parts of Latvia are critical.
This is the communication that has been disseminated this week by the volunteers of the 'My Sea' campaign.
For the fifth years of the Gulf of Riga, the activists concluded that the number of waste destined for one hundred metres has increased every one hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year's critical assessment has appeared.
"We see that this will be a year in which the number of waste on beaches in 100 metres may even exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio is a call, he came straight at the beaches, where he continues to volunteer along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, there have been even fluorescent lamps to be collected between different municipal waste and piknics, which are left to the sea in the sandwire.
It is the citizens who are to blame for the fault of the seat and the organiser, Ulme teic.
"The main source is the beaching visitors, as more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, different waste, starting with bag and bars, sheds, bottles, bottles, bottles, bottles, bottles, stories.
There are also swimming beaches in Riga.
For example, almost 800 waste units have been collected every one hundred metres on average every one hundred metres, which is critical.
The organisers of the campaign also say that you're going to smoke at every step, and not all the warning or ban marks everywhere.
"The average figures for the three Riga bathing sites, together with Daugavfloor, dinner and Acarers, are unfortunately harder and far above the desired or target of which Latvia is moving towards reducing the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020."
The cleaning of headquarters in Riga on a daily basis is twice as usual as the summer wall, Ugic Vidauski.
However, the battle with dirty visitors is rather difficult.
We return to this issue of human culture.
"To those who daughter, use alcohol, smoke and do all the things that may not even be scrupulously active," said Vidauski.
It therefore calls on the victims of the police to report their pollutants to the police.
It can be called police, reassess these irregularities and thus all to fight it.
Perhaps some new warnings may be made, but as I said, it is unlikely to change the situation radically.
"As everyone simply needs to turn and be intolerated against such offenders," he said.
In the meantime, an Health Inspection, which may impose a ban on official bathing sites, has already been carried out for a fourth time in the summer.
This year, like other years, water quality is well and satisfactory everywhere.
Today, the situation is that all 56 bathing sites have been good enough for all the time, and there is no grey at all.
"We will take the last analysis at the end of August," said Normunds Kadygar, the oldest professional for environmental health.
In heavy rain, the waste left on the ground may be broken down into water.
This, in turn, may have an impact on its quality, says an environmental officer.
Rotation Russian elites continues to change Rotation administered to Putina's administration.
He abandoned the post?
Vladimir Putin has announced the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would like to leave this post himself and will in future be the President's Special Representative for Nature Protection, Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes, Mr Putin to the television cameras commented Mr Ivanov: 'Cienable Sergej Borisvič, we have been working together for many years and we are doing so well. "
I am pleased with the role you have in your responsibilities.
I remember not to use you for this President in this President for more than four years.
I am therefore aware of your willingness to change the field of action.
And I hope that in the new post, you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is highlighted that the leadership of the President is a very important post and made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the fact that in Russia next month's State Duma elections were expected, rumours have been rumoured that this step would be linked to the fight for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov also called for the possible resignation of Mr Putin's president, so the claim he wanted to take up the post of President for the protection and transport of nature has raised doubts.
According to the Archives, Ivanov, Ivanov, the KICs and the Director-General of the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a sens and the neck of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He kicked off his light in the 1975-year period, which took place with Putin.
Later, Ivanov became Vice-President of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
The first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed as the Russian Security Council at the end of the day.
In 2000, the Ivanova worked security doctrine of Information Security, including Russia, was approved in office in 2000, which included a seizure of national censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became the Russian Minister for Defence, but already in 2005, Mikhail Farokova, the Deputy Prime Minister, and was responsible for the development of the Russian defence industry and arms exports.
Now, following the resignation of President Administration, Ivanov will also retain a seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the President of the Presidency-in-office, Vaino, will also work.
The Germans come from the elites of the family council.
The head of the president's administration, Vaino, said himself to be Ivanov.
We have long been familiar with Antonu Eduardović.
It is still the days when you worked under your leadership in government.
And in the last almost five years we have been in contact with practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, after all his professional and personal qualities, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The Germans come from a family that belonged to the Soviet party's elites.
His grandfather Karls held high posts in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988 to be the first Secretary.
The internet was a reference to a book entitled "Self-determination and independence of Estonia," that at the end of the 80.year Karle Vaino, he asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators.
However, he had received a refusal and has lost his seat soon.
Shortly after that, the Vaino has moved on to Moscow.
Antons Vaino has both pledded to the Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the language of the Japanese.
However, he has gone from a diplomatic service to work in the administration of the Presidential Protocol.
It has already been reported that the recent disturbances in Russia have been shaken by the exhibition and even arrests of several high-ranking officials, including the governor and federal representatives of several areas.
According to poitologists, President Vladimir Putin replaces the ruling elites before the elections in 2018 in 2018.
One of the main features is the increasing number of representatives of the governing bodies on board.
Also, the tournament in Niziforenus is losing out in the Olympic Games in the first battle.
This was a struggle in the first place, and the jarkets of Latvia have been climbed by their participation in the Olympic Games, finishing 17th.
Trenate Oleg Baskin Latvia's Television of Latvia recognised that Nizophrenus hope was very little and it has already been clear before the race.
He also said that the jago was a fierce trauma in the fight.
It is remarkable that, in order to get to the Olympic road signs, Nizikphorenko had to be placed in another weight category than the average - the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani kill was over 25 kilogrammes.
He has already been told that Jevgay Borodavko has been fighting Rjunosuki for two and a half minutes to the opponent.
Latvia is therefore close to the close of the Jane Connection.
The attacks disappear at the Rio Tills.
Mr Jevgeny Borodavko was first introduced on Thursday.
Yes, he was in favour of a more prominent opponent, but it is sometimes a surprise that we can be astonished.
He did not provide him.
The challenge of Nanoikiforenko was even more complicated, since the experience of a smaller and opposing nature is also more difficult.
The result is similar, on tatch, for one and a half per minute longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvia's juices are not exactly the most ambitious.
Gunars Kirsons and his financial staple and his financial staple and his financial staple, Alexandrs Jackelins, have passed away from Latvia, the Janus Score, the slot development round the curve of the recession.
The pitches of Kazakhstan who are advising Kazakhstan here, and Vsevolts Zodium, are not seeing the heirs of the mine.
But if it does not come, there will be no.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
That is why, as in the other gallery, the pledge of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation at Rio to fight medals from the Rio panels.
A flight far from reality.
MEPs will vote on a resolution on this topic.
The height of the 'death' group is the end of the game.
The Latvian duele had a small derogation - it could have been lost, but no more than four points in two six.
The past game has been blown up with the tense.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling above the cold corner's corrupt blank.
The changing wind turns out to be further complications.
At the beginning, it felt that it could be our own - which is more comprehensive - allies.
But it was not.
The Latvian duetus to play here was simply enough.
Serve so to Samoilovs and wait when he is going to burn.
Canada came out against Cuba, against Cuba at the end of the first sixth and the third beginning, because the load was not a joke.
The ferry was in the time, because the work was few, but when it was done honestly.
Brasics Samoilovs could win in two seasons, with the first reshuffling with 16: 15, but also 16 remained on the wastage of the lost points.
But we could have lost 0: 2, because the second sealed deficit was - 4, but also thanks to the wind we managed to win.
The third is that I have already gone for the list of Evane.
There was a smoothing - an unconvincing serve - the second puzzle often takes too close to the grid and Samoilovam remains a few options for a fruitful attack.
If there was an alien to Samoilovs in the field, he was more successful this time, and I would just like to pick up on my roads in an unprofessional manner.
The Kremlin, too, was wrong, and the symbol is symbolic that the last bumen bloc has been shot directly.
There is a team.
There was also a lack of success at this time, but there was also a total of two six Evane attacks on almost flights out of the corta, but the ball was a blow to the line.
The two eisi were on the side line.
The controversial episodes also decided to favour opponents.
If the first two games in the Evane have fought with the serwind, then they were very productive.
All together, the total amount lost on the taboo.
The causes of the failure must now be calmly analysed.
Maybe they should like to live next to the stadiums, not in conjunction with the delegation in the Olympic village.
A maximum of two and a half hours have elapsed.
It may be a bit self-convincing that the seven semi-finalists were inaugurated.
Maybe in Kehgenfurt should not have been played, but more quickly to appear here and better.
It was perhaps a mistake to find the virtual form of aspora.
So far, the question is more than answer.
Our bishops are at the end of the game.
The end of the medals closed.
What next?
There were still some of the World Cup turns and Jurmala Masters.
This is a friend of Samoilova's life and will not be because there are too different personalities.
But it is not needed either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals is collapsed, there is also the idea of divorce, because the blame will be sought not only in the face, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult, but it will be more difficult to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
Both brothers play the ball, but Janis already tried and also complained, and Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start taking on the world's surfaces.
We can look at Hartin Regime, Alexander Soloveva, the Edgar Top, to return to Mārtians, but it will not be better than this option, which in itself was not once demonstrated by itself at the time of the World Cup.
The sandhate lady was lucky at this time.
And all.
Of course, it is also necessary to take into account that beachlous voyleyleyball is becoming more popular, in circulation, and only less than two metres.
It does not yet guarantee success but an important argument in the fight for victory.
Nowadays, there are no longer.
Both sportspeople and journalists have the opportunity to settle in the venues offered by the host institution and to choose their own.
The US basketball team is living on a cruise ship, part of the tennis lag in the Olympic village.
Likewise, a part of the beachloyman's voyleyball is in the guest photograph of the Hotel Kopact.
This time, the entire modest hooligans on journalists were demanding high exaggerated prices.
Therefore, the choice has also fallen on the hot of the apes.
Risks are, sometimes, uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
At this time, the risk is justified.
Together with the rent of Vladimir Putin to the Roadmaps and the Ipanema border.
Men at 200 metres away, a bishop in the seizure of the pedestrians.
Rajon gana will be safe, as a faveal Patent, but there is no danger to lose.
Vladimir Vladimir Vladimir Putin, the most professional journalist in the Russian journalist, Vladimir Ivanov, is not the one that is immediately imaginable.
It would seem that on Friday morning it was a dream dream of another part of the medals.
In 100 metres in skiing and heath, Laura Ikauniece-Admidnight was lagging behind his personal record.
But there are already five disciplines.
After 10 years, Porgijs and Besa sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the Latvian National Operation operated in 1973 at the Latvian national operation, Porgijs and Besa.
Since then, the internationally recognized sentiment has not been beaten once again.
That is why the organisers of the Art Army Festival, and the Liepaja Army Forum, have chosen to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy the audience to the audience.
"It is a great pleasure that, after a ten-year break, when the last time in Liepaja was able to enjoy an operational study, this magnificent version of this magnificent George Garošvina to us in the new, the newly open concert hall, 'the great engine of the big engine', says the 'Lielais engines' leader Baiba Bože.
"Porgijs and Besa" is a splendid language in musical language, its lack of continuity, passion, as well as the tragedies of life and the ordinary day-to-day tragedies.
It reflects the American vitality, music and ritory of the hafro-American.
It is that lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love is extremely strong, extremely beautiful, and in some way it is really deep."
What I like most is listening to or through this operation, there are always the stops: the famous melody, the famous motive, but these are transitional from one nature to another, in the light of one personal, or other, or the orchestra.
"This is the most exciting, construction," opera valued operas Porgijs and Besa, the manager of the concert at Porgijs and Besa, and Andris Poga.
Operators are in agreement that it is a grand event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear the famous Garošt operation in this world.
It is hard to feel the elite of the world.
"He's professional," the visitor appreciates the visitor.
The reflection was a special example of the first instance of an orchestra in the newly open concert, the orchestra played and the first to take account of the concert behaviour.
The wall of the Art Museum on behalf of the Art Grand Museum could be named in the name of Jak Rozentala.
Andris America's Speaker of the Rozentanla jubile exhibition reported that the museum's own address in the future might not be a criticism of a criticism of a criticism by the conservatism of Valdemar Street, but Jamage's Rozendal Square 1.
Mumbai, director of Mumbia, said that the reregistration of the address would create a good bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea was welcomed and has therefore agreed to a local initiative.
The city of Riga has turned to the idea of a sort of foundation in 196, setting up a monument to the Museum in Burhda's monument to Mr Janim Rozenan.
The former director, Will Purhman, was one of the originators for this monument.
In this way, it could be purely logical.
It is a little hot to the conscience, both for all the time, but the Vilhelm Purhman, where we will make his name?!
"But if you, Mr America, are going to think about...
The National Army Museum is told that the National Army Museum has formally opened their doors in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the EAGF will finally be launched.
Around EUR 11 million will be updated by around €11 million in Wales.
The plans are planned for the renewal of a number of pilots, including two audiences, as well as adapting the buildings to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to attract EUR six million money from the European Union funds, but the Riga City Council's Directorate General Oleg Burovs said that there is still not yet complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"In spite of the fact that the political will to launch the EAGF Cultural pilij in the cultural pilij by attracting European structural funds is we in months awaiting decisions, real action from the officials of the Finance Ministry, will be awarded or not," he said.
In December last year, we were told that everything is dependent on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry received a letter from the European Commission that it would take the decision that Brussels would not take a decision here.
Now we see that yet another round of discussions is emerging, we will see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council without doubt guarantees that the process will be initiated and completed within the time limits," he said.
As reported, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Palace was collectively hosted by the EF Cultural Palace, ahead of the immediate renovation of the future building.
Though a year later, renovation has still not started and collectively continued to work under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy for the EF Culture Centangle, the Riga City Council will distribute seemingly independent rebuilding works together, where each will ensure the implementation of different outlines.
First: maximising the accessibility of the EAGF and improving the area of the surrounding area.
It is designed to put in place the surroundings and engineers, and to restore the pre-packages of the building.
Second - improving the supply of services of VEF Culture.
It plans to improve the study of the interior, wall and Greeks, watch the record of the building and the audience, as well as to clean up the buildings' internal engineers.
The third is an improvement in the collective working conditions of Radical amateur, which includes plans to improve workshops, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the "Lal" 40, the legendary rock is exhibited by the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will cover different types of "Late" items - photographs which have been arranged to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to 2010 when the group expires.
It will also show the spectacles of the participants, the music instruments, awards and the concerts, as well as other unwittingly reported cases, which reflected the creative activities of the group 'Laugurts'.
The exhibition will be supplemented by the articles of the Liepaja Museum.
The visual presentation of the test is in cooperation with the fashion artist and the Ghleznorer Elit Patmalian.
The musicians involved in the group 'Luss' and their relatives referred to the call and shared with objects and memory.
"Lal" is in 1970 when the Liepaja Culture House is set up to establish the vocal instrument at the centre of the Culture House led by Juris Pathyol.
The analysis was first held in the festival "Liepaja engines" in 1972 and 1971, as well as cities and republics.
In 1971, a meeting was held in 1970, when Juris Pahille took note of the Stakesh and Football Championship in the pile of Metalurg, calling for the Ingrids Guard, Andrus Krumins and Jun Grodance, to join.
For the years, the group's composition has not been delivered once alone.
Participants have joined the others, others have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to show that Latvian arms are able to live and survive - remained stable.
"What a lack of lack of existence - the jure, magazine and bearings - these boys differ from the widely accepted forms of erection."
He went without the musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Krievins, Modris Šterme, Valdis Chaark, Laimis Raccene, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brise, Guntars Virga, Sheet Klein and many others.
The edition shall be carried out free of charge.
The exhibition shall be carried out from 19 August to 30 October.
There will also be a group of MEPs who will vote on the report on Tuesday.
There is inflation in Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months.

I would like to give a feet in the last day to the service.
Last year, I addressed Pope Franciska si and I put up the common house on the Earth, the Earth's theme in the Latvian context.
This year... I am watching what is happening in the world and trying to respond to it in your speech.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Ewaves message should be put at the centre of life.
It has to be demonstrated that the Eadel is responsible for the most painful problems of human life and gives him an inspiration for the journey.
Then it addresses the people.
But, in the Chamber, the Channel, you said, 'go back to the awareness of the people.'
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person has taken away from the embassy of the church?
And is the church today having such a return resource?

According to his candidacy to the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, has bailed out the government from falling, as an associated professor of the University of Social Sciences University of the University of Latvia, Oir Sir Sudra.
Recording of Kolegova as a candidate for candidacy in relation to the contradictory ruling in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
He told LETA that he would find it hard to imagine that next week in the government "Unity" would support Kolegova's candidacy.
Consequently, if Unity ministers would vote against, but Kolegova would be in office, it would lead to government demissions.
The expert also considers that, prior to the withdrawal notification, Kolegova has been consulted with both Finance Minister Danes Reiznieci-Ozene and the Prime Minister Mars Kuchinski.
At the same time, it was also a concession to the "Unity," which were strongly opposed to her candidacy.
In the projection, or successful in finding a suitable candidate, the Skimudad acknowledged that there are two options: either to select a figure of a compromise, or the authority as Director-General of Directors, will continue to lead the Dace Pelka.
At the same time, he points out that if the finance minister so far argued that there was no other candidate, it was a shot in the Bashot that they should not be in competition.
As reported, Kolegova, the head of the State Environment Service, has decided to withdraw its candidacy for the post of Director-General of the Revenue Service.
As a result of the Unity's reservations, the government on Tuesday postponed the approval of Kolegova to the Director General of the Revenue Service.
Following a decision by the government, Mr Kolegova confirmed that it was still ready to be head of the Revenue Service.
However, it was later rethought - on Friday, for Finance Minister Danai Reiznielis Ozlai, to withdraw his consent to transfer to the head of the Revenue Service and his or her absence.
Andrei Vaivars, Prime Minister Andrei Vaivars, told LETA that there would be a new competition for the vacant's head of the Revenue Service.

The passes of the media reveal the reconstruction of the reconstructed road.
Traffic Minister Uldis Augulis, VAS Latvian State roads (LVC) management, as well as the Binders "Binders" and local representatives today discovered the frontier Russian border (A13) of the country's main autocratic motorway (Grebán) and Lithuania (A13) to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05km).
The roads are a country's visit card, especially border routes, and therefore, special satisfaction is to discover reconstruction at the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of how the European Union's fund for cofinancing is improving on the main roads of the country.
"As the forecasts suggest, the funds available on the roads will be covered already in 2018, and we need to think about continuing the most burdensome motorways in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding," the Uldis Augulis said.
The Transport Minister also pointed out that the proposals for sustainable funding on Latvia's roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
In the early stages of the honey from the media to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km), the SIA Binders started last year and followed them in a technological break this year.
The cost of the Reconstruction is €13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The reconstruction of the road is fully renovated and repaired next year from the media to Daugavpilij, so that the whole route from Lithuania to Daugavpilij will begin next year," Janis Lange, the President of the LVC General Board.
The country's main motorways are the most busy and until 2018 we intend to ensure that all the main roads in the country are in good condition.
The next challenge will be to maintain them in good quality by ensuring the regular maintenance of periodicals and to carry out asphalt surfaces every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all of them are hoping to look at the proposals developed by the group of experts for the adjustment of the road financing system."
The project arranges road connections and lighting in the Centre of the Media.
Significant ground works: in four stages large scale disgraceful and grooming and grooming work equated to a very uneven nature.
Public transport facilities have also been renovated and a reshuffle is rebuilt for public transport.
In the past, the potato and the love of the love were not due to a remnant valley, as well as the old route of a common ground.
The next construction work season is planned to rebuild the motorway from the city of Daugavpils to the reconstruction phase (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, the LVC intends to carry out various types of work over 1100 kilometres.
Information on all repairs planned for the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.enceli.en
"In order to achieve the desired weight reduction results, the choice of the correct combination of food products is vital," he said.
In addition, it is easy to do during the summer period when our own gardens grow, ogas and vegetables.
Combining dietary products can help not only to reduce overweight, but also to make a targeted effort to promote different organism processes.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a lasting sense of consciousness and help to combat fat.
Studies published in the European Clinical Blogbook have shown that the label has a positive effect on the blood of glucose and help us to feel cheerful.
It is not only a sense of feelings, but also a lesson from the snow, but also to reduce the carpet after major meals in the coming meal.
Such a combination of food is also able to increase the quantities of caloria incinerated by the mess to 35%.
Studies show that Kajic pipari can be helped to get rid of the wall of fat wins.
There is a medieval organic food - a mein, a medieval source of medieval, as a good source of vitamin C.
In the case of sufficient quantities of these nutrients, it is possible to reduce the level of cormorol, hence also the accumulation of fat in the body average.
The bottlenect of the axles to which fresh ports are added is another spirit of spirit and fat for breakfast, which is worth including on its own menu.
Auzzes and oks contain fibre which, according to the Canadians' conclusions, are controlled by the ruminant: the appetite to the hormone-stimulating hormone - and thus also a sense of hunger.
In addition, they contain polyphenols that are half-weight and also prevent the formation of fat.
Pressures and protein also play a role in reducing the weight of mixes.
This combination is capable of creating a feeling of consciousness.
Pressure contains water and fibre, and therefore contributes to the feeling of consciousness.
At the same time, the protein is slowly slowing down and providing a sense of sense for a longer time.
Eggs can be hot on the island or prepared for a mixture of protein from the prepared mixture and enjoy it with their favourite vegetables.
Any combination of product combinations shall be avoided.
There are sugar - monosaccharides or disaccharides - of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch of vegetables is a poisacharde.
The plants are mechanically mechanically mechanical and chemically disaggregated until a third or fourth insinuation in the zarnia process is reached.
The close is divided into three different stages, starting already in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the hunt immediately after the meal.
Getting a hungry bag straight away after the meal, it is "protracted" in the max with other meals, where it is not chemically disturbing and starting to crowd.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, horses, gangs, files or other carbohydrate, together with citrons, luck, orphans, grapphs, ananays or other acids.

The Black Sea is not far removed if it is in a mafe with other foodstuffs.
The combination of people with protein for rich products.
Fans make a successful combination of suffering, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein: fat is hampered by protein supply.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
When a large quantity of products containing protein is consumed, fat shall be avoided at all.
This also applies to fresh: it is not advisable to combine a large amount of nuts (contains protein) with a whole source of fat (contains fat).
A combination of such combinations is hampered by effective reduction.
How is it better prepared?
"Cooking, termism processing poses a significant loss of nutrients, about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient profile of the products."
In the majority of cases, nutrients are still in loss, by pooling food in the water.
However, the nutritional value of some foods is increasing, in particular by weakness.
In the case of vegetable dwellings, it is advisable to use for the preparation of a tout - in this case, you will not lose the nutrient that is left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It would also be advisable to draw up, including by steering them.
Threats to bioaccessibility in tomatoes present in tomatoes are significantly increased by the treatment processing.
In the case of tomatoes 30 minutes, the quantity of opponents will increase by 25%.
Things also significantly increase the availability of betaflags, which can be found in red, yellow, orange crops such as in tomatoes, the bottom, in the sweet potatoes, and spur.
The processing of Ol and meat thermoke deprives them of the natural characteristics of the existing protein, making them more easily accessible.
Similarly, the processing of meat and egg termism makes it easier for the railways and other minerals in the product to be easily absorbed in the organism.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the quantity of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, while the freezing of the fibre is not affected.
In combination with tomatoes, tomatoes may be increased by the Iron Curtain into an organism which, in turn, ensures better brain and muscular behaviour.
Our organism takes up to 33% less blood-blood iron, which can be found in plant products such as bottles, sheets, cereal, cereal, iron iron such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can make a significant contribution to the introduction of an un-blood-borne iron in the organism by consuming diet-blood iron products together with C vitamin sources such as oranges, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change the dreadful iron iron so that it is easier to absorb by our organism.
The iron is necessary for the production of chemoths for global production, which provides oxygen in muscles and brains.
In order to be able to make the most of the salate, add to them healthy fat, such as olive or flax oil.
Looking ahead with your readers, add to D vitamins of the vitamins of D or sardated yoghurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the quantity of calcium in the zarnia and plays an important role in the process of building bone.

Snapchat Anime criticizes for the war of war
Snapchat says that this filter has inspired animation, but some commentators claim that it is raistically insensitive.
With this slow effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality and play their identity at all absurdly every day.
You can turn themselves into an ananax, a dog or a father who seized Roja Lihštenstein.
Lucks are footage, pictures of mutilation, which generates more than 30 million selfia per day.
Any error shall be made public.
Snapchat lenses have already been criticised in the past with the discard that the app promotes too black or gaseous faces as the ideal benchmark of beautiful etalum.
This week, new lenses were published, allowing users to build up their soils, sorts and shoes, and some critics called it a racist cartoons - 'yellow gauge'.
Similarly, the question was asked whether these contradictions do not show that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public spaces outflowed on Wednesday when The Verge and Motherboard said that slowes have been withdrawn from taxation.
The company explained that the slow aim is to portray the images of the Anti's fathers rather than to kick-start the people of origin.
But people who have experienced racism reminded these effects of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied similarity with the Anti.
The twitter stories of the Latvian Army Study's Greisas Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparaga Sparapani told AFP.
She added that it is difficult not to miss eye on the obvious similarities between assimively cartoons and lenses.
This shows that the slow effect of the slow effect is not simply the face of yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that is in these cultural traps.
American culture is also engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from business meetings to Hollywood and the devices used on a day-to-day basis.
And Snapchat large young audience, representing different race, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that insulates users, "today these things do not go unnoticed."
On Thursday, the company's' Medium 'product driver, Jacques Barrot, deleted his / her Snapchat appraisal and recommended others to do the same.
In his article "Medium" and the telephone interview, she explained that the problem of rainy arises from the employment policy of Snapchat, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
He criticised the company's management, which is mainly male and then concluded with a reference to #ExteSnapchatus.
"This means that there is no race in the company, so decisions are made: there are some other races in the company, but they do not take up a post so that they can express their views safely and comfortably."
They also agree with others, while Snapchat has not replied to her complaint.
The company does not reveal the number of employees from different race, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his or her staff, but the spokesman said that the company had a number of staff professionals, who will concentrate on the representation of racial minorities in the company, which are not broadly represented and will contribute to the establishment of the company.
However, he would not rebuild his Snapchat account, adding: "Interessivors really need more users than we do to realise that it is wrong."
The Congress of Congress declares that the Islamic Wales reports have been distorted by the military officials.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the Congress of Congress indicates that the US central authorities have raised reports by depicting the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria more optimistic than is actually the case.
The analyst analysts of the central service intelligence service expresses its general disagreement over the temporary report of the Republican Committee, the Committee on the Finance of the Board of Supervisors and the Republican Defenders, stating that their management was controlling the American success in the fight against the Islamic Wales.
Central orders known as Centcom are a military base in Tampere, Florida, which oversees the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of this report shows that the intelligence service's reports approved by senior Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more favourably than is actually the fact that the Facts were regularly distorted, showing better progress than other intelligence analysis.
According to California Republican Representative Kens Kalverts: "The behaviour of Centcom is unacceptable: our soldiers are suffering if our policy makers are receiving false reports."
The managerial mistakes of Centcom are to be found in senior management.
This 10 sheets report details the current problems in the coverage and analysis of the central orders of the Central Liaison Officer in an analysis of the American efforts to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide an inconclusive proof that the senior officials of the Obama administration would have missed the reports, it shows that the management of Centcom has made some of the pressure on analysts a more optimistic view on the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report points out that in the first half of 2015, press releases, statements and reports by the central administration in the Congress represent the situation in a considerably more positive light than was actually the case.
For example, the representatives of Centcom publicly declared that the operation of Mosul could start on April or May 2015 as early as April 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still in the control of the Islamic State.
Speaking in his report, the representative of the Canadian Republican Party, Master Pompeo, said in his report: "A series of months' investigations show that this is clear."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, the main officials of the US Central Administration were overseen by depicting ISIS threats to the weaker in Iraq than were actually the case.
The Republican party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being distorted.
The report will be followed by new findings on the file, which will be published on Thursday.
The Directorate General for the Department of Defence shall carry out an investigation into the activities of the intelligence service Centcom.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Party Committee made their own reports in which they agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Party.
The Democratic representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of the Congo (1970).
Mr Schifa said that this process was' halting the dissemination of information ', worsened the ethics of analysts and' spread the false facts'.
But the Sifs and Democrats added that there was no evidence that the White House had done pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports, in accordance with "pre-defined or political positions."
The Daily Beast published the preliminary findings of the Congress of Congress on Thursday.
In August The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspection started an investigation after the complaints by the Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon spokesman, lieuitnant, Patrick Evans, stated that the Pentagon would not comment on the Congress's report until the investigation continues.
He also said that experts sometimes interpret difficult data and the Ministry of Defence and intelligence are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not just about the question of whether an American bombardment campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (the statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But the accusations of last year call into question whether President Obama is able to rely fully on the reports by Central Governance on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticing the intelligence of Islamic State intelligence over a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analysts, Gregorijs Her, published a study, claiming that George W. Bush started a Afghan war, too little thinking about its possible consequences.
The husband also played an important role in the discovery of the intelligence of Islamic State.
Last year, official representatives reported that the team of Heuve showed that against the public reports, air strikes in Islamic State oil factories have not significantly impaired the financial position of the terrorist group because they had been built on temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September reported that this open did not come outside the walls of the central administration.
At the moment, Centcom's commander, General Loft Ostins III, received sharp criticism because many of the laws were considered to describe the situation too much.
In April, General Ostar was held in Ostar, and his seat was taken by General Jorezefs L. Votels.
In the US, in a dozen hostages with Britain, the US wins in the US to win the fourth consecutive consecutive consecutive consecutive round-up.
On the day after the victory over Japan with a scoreboard 6: 1 on Thursday, Kitteria scored the first two rains of the US Women's Hockey team, with an Indian team of 3: 0.
Five wins in two games are an unforgeable achievement, but the 27 years old Bam said it was not to be remembered, or what she had to do at some point in the past.
She said: 'I have no idea'.
I am not one of those people who rank their gates.
But she knows that the Americans are going to have a 4: 0, which, in their own group, gives them a break with Britain, which, on Thursday with a scoreboard of 2: 0 remained unsuccessful.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to match the last match.
The two teams are already qualified for a four-year team in the six team teams and their second place.
The first prize wrote a little longer from a meeting with a strong Dutch reading, which is the leader of the second group.
In order to avoid a seven-day game, the Americans have already made a surprise storm four years ago in London between 12 teams.
The team also had Bama.
She wrote the hockey hockey for the first time in his hands over the age of 3 years old (her old daughter sisters had already worked with his old daughter) and joined the national sample when she was 16 years old, becoming a random guns in the history of the players.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because he was not present.
However, 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
In the next year, the English Kregs Parghur was appointed and all changed for the better.
He called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
In London, we did not invest as much as we now.
We have altered everything.
On Thursday, Bama found the result by winning the gateway at the first half of my close.
India was playing without victory in its own account, but their tip was very cheerful and held a minimal result 0: 1 to the end of the third period when the gates were once again greeted.
She scored the ball in the right-wing zone on the right side of the square, then noticed the middle side of the square and send bombings to the wall to send the ball to the American 2: 0.
Melisa Gonzalesa had another gateway in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first US gate guard at the Bruges of Bruges, each of the first three games to be traded alone.
She has come here.
And likewise Bama.
"We are going very well at the moment," said Pahmi, but how well it will be on Saturday.
The depressing ear of the depression period is the "smart meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the president, the Frenchman Delano Rigned in the oval room to go to the wrong.
President Ruloires garden a fine cult of a fine culinary as a zoos in the fuel-fuel-turtles.
But, on that occasion, his meal was much more modest: the metal of eggs in tomatoes, the potato and desert of the potato and desert.
Mr Ziegelmane is saying: 'This is a way of solidarity with the people who have been very hard to prepare. "
Her man said: "This is also the message to the Americans as we should eat."
The Heights of Brooklyn is the historian historian.
The last book "Prescription" describes the Chinese kitchen in America and Zieelmane, in his book, describes the life of 97 Awards through the east-home town of Manhattan.
Their new joint work on the 'smart meal' published on Tuesday will be a story of the Americans during the Great Depression of the Americans.
To show solidarity in the culinary, they held a meal together of the Eisenberg's Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandwich Sandw@@
The 54 year-old ZiegelmanI ordered a singer with the blank and blowed olives, and the 50-year-old Kou ordered the tiger, potato thicker and vegetable salt.
When the fortune ordered a fake green, a few admitted that his choice is very appropriate to talk about the high depression of the Great Depression.
Mrs ZiegelmanI said that the fake blue was very popular.
There was a globe of the globe, the lag sadder and the bottle of puzzes.
They were made from the basic components and other ingredients that have enriched the wrong.
It is supposed to be - to eat so many peanuts in order to be in the place of lunch.
Mr Kou wrote.
"It was probably full of lead," he added.
In the past years, the American lunch was matched by the head of the Swedes, particularly in rural areas.
Women prepared for their men to eat to their men, their workers and breakfast, lunch and dinner blamps.
At the time of the first World War, it was the Americans who sent Europeans a day, the 'smart meal' describes how the Americans were adapting to the circumstances when America was suddenly no longer a country of surge.
"At the time, it was a day of dawn to the American people's main focus on everyday life," story Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write precisely on the subject.
Just as significant became the new budget districts: such uncertain meals such as the false samele and the indignation became daily, indignation was "an excellent way to use surpluses."
Fresh crops were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat which has been the main component of the Americans for years now became an extremely rare commodity.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutrition is more important than long, born new, unwittingly formations.
Ms Ziegelmanman, in an ancient hemicycle, found the recipe for a peanuts with a fine line.
Mr Kou added: 'It was not a popular penetration.
Mrs Ziegelmanman emphasizes: 'It's surreal'.
The butter and funny blow are not compatible.
Many homes applied to difficult times.
households' economists, such as Luge Stenlia, Head of the Federal Ministry of Household Economy, from 1923 to 1943, imposed state-building habits that were not seen before the Great Depression or beyond.
When publishing articles and prescriptions and magazines, they recommended that households should be 'economists' and to accept challenges such as the potato and carrot of magazines in the garden edge.
"The intelligence Maltese" is a historic taste.
Especially interesting is evidence of the attitude of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Hugal, allow me to eat a peak.
Although he told the public about his simple childhood and caning in Aiova, he was in fact eating the millionaire for which he had become.
Mr Kou is telling: 'He was a European kitchen, for example, fish with cucumbers'.
He was eating almost in the victorious guarantor, with a semi-day jail.
He was completely removed from reality.
President Rigel would have made the same mistake, unless his wife, Eleonora, has recommended to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Rigned is a domestic worker who has not taught eating, so the White House became the place "where not only was one of the most inspiring food in Washington, but also the worst food."
As soon as the national economy materialises, the majority of depression ultra-gathers have disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calorific and nutritional value, as well as to the use of science in the culinary, Mrs Ziegelman.
We have been told that, in writing books, they gained greater awareness of Mrs Ziegelmanman's mother eating habits, for example, why she was unable to discard the food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the day," Mr Kou said.
Mrs Ziegelmanman said, 'She was actually tracking people'.
There was an incident with wind blanks.

"It's a bottleneck," said Mr Ziegelman, adding that it was at the time that an affair was spread to modest food.
It contains no bottles, just dried floods, slightly miles, water, and canteens.
It was an unsolicited mask of the flag that was on the plate.
Again, it was not so bad.
Mr Kou was eating a few more kidnappings.
He said after a experienced 'economy room', he said, 'I would like to get a laden nut. "
Adjustments for legal expenditure in the fight against the Hepatitis C Patent
A parcel judge has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc" has the right to receive back the cost of a lawyer against the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of the 200 million pounds in the case of the two Merck Patents, which threatened it in connection with the successful Sorule and Harvoni tablets, when the US Federal judge identified irregularities in the operation of Merk in the US, such as the transfer of caning and other unethical practices.
On Thursday, Judge Bet Labson Fmorning, the US district judge, said that Gilead is entitled to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred in this case.
Merck is trying to obtain a position on the market against Gilead, which is dominated by the new generation of Hepatitis C, which is effective 90% in cases of liver disease.
The case was launched already in 2013 when Gilead and Merck took one another in an attempt to obtain ownership of the newly developed active components phosphibbvir, which is a key element of Gilead medicinal products.

"Today, the city is in full control of our control and we are carrying out fighters," Reuters told Reuters.
Clinton's income in 2015 reached €10.75 million and has paid 34,2 percent of federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released 2015's tax declaration of 2015, which shows that the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and her husband had earned EUR 10.75 million in this year and a federal tax rate of 34,2 percent.
Clinton has donated USD 1 million in 2015, mainly to its Clinton charity organisation, former president Bill Clinton earned around 5.3 million dollars, insisting as a spiral and a former State Secretary benefitting 3 million dollars from their books on the work of Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's electoral allies - Tims Keins, the US Virgin, Timor Keins and his wife Anna Hollinton released their tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015 they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
Hillary Clinton and Tims Kein are continuing to impose new standards of financial transparency, "said Clinton's campaign partner Jenifera Palace.
By contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind the various pretexts and reservations, so that promises to disclose their tax information should not be fulfilled.
The publication of the Nominal Tax information is a record of the US presidential candidates, but it is not a law that is required.
Trump and his lawyer, New York, have an audit of the National Interest Service as a reason to discover tax information.
"Your march," on his own Twitter account, Clinton told Clinton's campaign partner Ian Sami.
On Thursday, Trump told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish tax information before they are completed.
Trump criticizes, including Republican presidential candidate Mite Romney and other Republican presidential candidates for the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, say that his refusal raises questions about his true properties and the amount of donations and other his business obligations, including commitments to Russia.
Clinton made an oil hille by publishing a video on Friday, where a number of powerful Republican presidents request Trump to publish his tax information.
She came back to this issue in an economic speech on Thursday, in Michigan.
She made an announcement: "He refuses to do what has been done for several decades by other presidential candidates."
"Politico said two years ago, Trump has paid very little or no taxes at all or at least to pay taxes on Friday at the New York Times, saying that many of the accountants and lawyers said that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a major issue in this presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the billionaire of the billionaire, promotes the idea that everyone who earn more than $1 million a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, Clinton was speaking at Omahana, in Nebraic, where his conglomerate of Berkshire Hathaway is also in a conglomerate, Bafeta to exchange tax declarations.
The Bafeta said he was also carrying out an audit of the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of his constituents, not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax information up to 2007.
Clinton is now living in Clinton, in New York and between 2007 and 2014, the average federal tax rate of 32 percent and a total tax rate of approximately 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 tax review shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars on their income are wage.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which $109,000 received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish Fillets criticise hotel in Berlin on the removal of the Israeli-Palestinian Cod, following the request by the RT: RT:
The Spanish film director of Jewish French films made a storm on the social media in Berlin when it revealed that the "Kempinski Bristol" in Berlin did not have access to the Israeli litigation code, which is justified by the demand of the Arab clients.
Klods Lanchman, documentary films on the Holocaust Holocaust director Shoah, were not dissatisfied with the Berlin "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit to Lanzes, an attempt was made by Lanzmans to find a list of the State of Israel's long-distance shop on the proposed list.
However, this country was not included in the list with countries to which it can be made directly from a hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been tortured and destroyed?
Writing Lancmans.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol is proposing to call this country through its call centre.
The delegation asked for an explanation from the hotel's staff.
Lanzmans writes that the answer he received was "shocked."
The Hotel administrator explained that "it was a conscious hotel's decision."
The reason for withdrawal was further sanctioned by a film director.
"The majority of visitors are Arabs and they demanded an extermination of the Israeli code," Lanzmans quoted an explanation for the worker in the hotel.
Suddeutsche Zeitung tells me that the Israeli ambassador to Germany Jakovs Hadas-Handelsmann was called a "great shame."
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
This is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany is even more humiliating in this hotel network.
Self-explanatory.
He said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event has also gained a rather wide range of repercussions on the Internet, where people have called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel was simply extracted by Arab customers.
A different recording of the stories said that the hotel is in Kurfur-endamm to the nearby synagogai.
Der Spiegel said that the hotel herself was quick to dismiss all the accusations, stating that it was all "misunderstandings" and apologised for Lanzmanam.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Sudan Zeitung cites Kempinski.
And to add that the code is once again accompanied by a list.
Police use rubber bullets and tear gas against the protesters of Brazil.
A student and police collision took place on Thursday in Sanpaulu in Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against the reform of the educational system.
Police used rubber bullets and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the Ombudsman tried to drive students with rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to show their reluctance to reform the education system.
The proposal is to close to almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be relocated to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some of the demonstrators have brushed on walls with messages against the interim president, Mr Temera.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the student gathered to support President Dylan Rousefai, who voted through the Senate.
A Scottish Siners finishers in the finishop at the finishop when he seemed Britain's gold medals in cycling
A member of Scotland's finishers finisher will be the first male team at the Rio Partners at the Rio Ticycle, which took place last night, the British team protected the title of the team, which was won at the London matches in 2012.
The 23 year-old athlest played an important role in these events, making a pride of legitimate Scottish Krisu Krisu Hoya and the victory for favourite New Zealand.
Five years ago, Britain won an astonishing victory when the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals won the fifth.
And they reiterated this in the World Cup in London, even though the Host had finished his athlete's career.
The problem was between the Beijing Olympics and the London Olympic Games, due to the replacement of the experienced interethnic officer Stpha.
They managed to do this at the last minute.
When the Hoy went, she tried to fill in Kians Emadi and Met Krampton.
The British coaches put their hope to the Skills, see the potential that he has also shown later.
Hindes, Kenya: Championships seated four years ago with Hoes and Skiners, who installed the Olympic qualification record four years, but the kitchen kicks better at New Zealand's team
However, the British trio won the gold medals.
The Hindes had blowed up in a close look at the shores, under the leadership of the Kenyans, and defended the leadership for this leadership.
A change in the strategy played an important role in the victory, as Hindes came with more carry-overs to allow Kenya and, in particular, the Skiner to drive faster.
Holy said, as a representative of the BBC and the Speaker of the Skinera, Kenya and Hindesa, at the moment when they went to a plea pumph.
The 23 year-old glazgolan said: 'It was a false honour'.
I do everything to protect your name.
We put the Olympic record and the World Championships in the film.
It was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After his victory with Kenya and the Hoes in London in 2012, the Hindes will find that they were deliberately falling into a crackdown after the failed start.
Later, he wrote and the British competitor did not have to prove the opposite.
There was no incident here this time.
Hindes said: "Britain's flags in the tribins were in memory of London."
In the last 3 months, we have become an island of unity.
We have lost so many world championships, so that the Olympic Games were really special.
One piece will be rained by a country that won seven out of ten gold medals in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team scoreboard over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of the outcome of Kenya, he could indeed repeat the success of the Holland's three Olympic gold medals.
In Kenya, this would mean six gold and a silver medal, and Kenya has also been born on 23 March (it appears that it was a British holy date, because it was also the same day that Stray Regreivks, Mo Farah and Rodžers Banisters were born.
Holy also was born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will run for the next three days.
A 28 year-old athlever from Boltton said: "I just enjoy it at the moment.
The work of the wars is always the best.
For then you can win together with teammen.
If fair, it is a little single to win. "
Hindes said: "If he gets another gold medals, he should appoint a counterparty."
On that day it was the only battle for the medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bredlijs Vigins, Eds Klensium, Stiers Burks and Oveins Douls showed faster qualification for four kilometres in four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The world record, which was fitted in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and finalisation will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, before the qualification, he had disagreements with the commission, when he was convened by judges to measure his fruits.
Laura Trota, Laura Trota, Jos Rovselsellselus Shanda, Laura Trota, Jos Rovselselus Shanda, Elinora Barkere and Kaitija Archibalda from Milan, installed a new record of 4: 13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British wheeled team will win a medals during the Olympic Games.
Faced with the great and unfortunate performance of Beijing and London in London and London, all of these achievements are expected to have the same effect as Rio.
In the meantime, there has been a lot of crowds, after being accused of sexism and dignity, the resignation of a technical director, Shea Satonon, and also a career as well as the Bendletone.
However, when we started on first bicycle, it seems that Britain, as always, will reach the highest level in real time.
The future of the Portland Bup is becoming uncertain because an ambitious treaty has been suspended.
Aluminium slaughterhouses and the future of hundreds of its staff in Portlenda have become uncertain, as the company's main customer's energy company has announced a suspension of cooperation.
This statement is based on the plans by the Viktoria Government to suspend the subsidisation of energy companies, which is vital to enable the company to continue to work.
20 years of subsidies will cease in November.
With this, more than 2 000 Alcoa Portland's facilities are at risk.
It could be up to 2 000 directly or indirectly.
In addition, it will also have an unforeseeable side effect, as around 10 percent of the electricity supply is consumed by the slaughterhouse.
In 2014, Alcoa replaced Point Henry, which led to the Angleseas power plant break.
Alcoa Portland is on loss and may be closed.
These events have caused several years of speculation on the cost of Australia dollar and factory production.
The industrial energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its "Loy Yang A" power plant in Latroubes, says that the other three owners are likely to suspend their contracts as well.
Most power stations belong to Alcoa and Alumia to the Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the company's shares in the CITIC and the Japanese "Marubeni Corp."
"IGL" looks forward to continuing the Portland factory, which would mean a future energy supply battle, "the spokesman said.
AGL reported that contracts are so-called "risk restrictive contracts," to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts are valid for a 12-month period and will therefore be in force until 2017.
"AGL is planning to receive revenue from these contracts in the 2017 fiscal year," the company spokesman said.
Starting from the likely impact of 2018 on profit, market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices are limited.
"AGL" states that in their forecasts, there has already been an amount of USD 187 million worth of damage, provided that these contracts will be interrupted.
Alcoa says that the decision to terminate contracts would not affect the activities of the Alcoa, or the power to deliver energy.
The US company tells me that it concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but in November it will be interrupted. The company does not provide clarification as to why it will suspend its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about the possible closure of the Portland Bup in the Viktoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, the industry's weak economy.
"AGL Chief Executive Director Stieren Mikelson said last week that the analysts estimate 600 megavatus and Tomago 900 megavatus.
If both plants are to be left out of the energy market, energy demand would decrease significantly.
And that would not be a good thing.
The Community's legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year, with a decrease in the budget, the situation could deteriorate.
Three out of five people in Ktarsland - mostly pensioners, immigrant workers, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal eviction, refuse legal assistance and representation.
The Community's legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only become worse.
From June next year these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than it has been to date.
James Fareh, director of the Legal Centre of the Law Centre of Capitals, said that the latest version of the Association report of the National Legal Centre said that legal aid is now being refused to thousands of people in need.
Mistrs Farele said that if this decision is not lifted, the situation will only become worse.
He also says: 'The Kvinesland legal centre is constantly underfunded, which means that the assistance of thousands of people in need is refused. "
People who are trying to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debts, to the families that are dishonestly discounted - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the assistance they need.
From December 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which means that several thousand thousands of people in Kinesland will have to deal with their difficult legal problems without help.
We call on the Chief Prosecutor of the Attorney General and the Kwine Senator, George Brandisi, to halt the reduction of funding immediately, so that people in need of legal assistance can obtain it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to raise the level of legal assistance to the national average.
Now it is time to draw attention to the needs of the local communities and their clients and the Palazshuka Government to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign to be brought before a court, as an employee issued a firearm
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organisers were instituted in court because they had not acted on receiving information that its North Carolina Operation Manager has opened a firearm to a worker when they have travelled in one car in February.
This incident was described in court cases submitted on Wednesday by Mr Bordini, a former campaigner.
Bordini said that he had been waiting for months to start this case, but it understood that this would not happen.
The leader of the man, the Philippines, wrote the pistol, put his good news on the meat and paved the way against his job, "Bordini claims in his or her complaint.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini learned that at least four people still have experienced the same.
"The Roma do not have to shut down to create losses," said Bordini in his complaint.
Just two days before the file was submitted, the candidate for the Republican Party gave a scandal to the post of President, stating to people that "the people of the second amendment people," i.e. the owners and enthusiasm of the weapons, could take action in the event of the election of his Finnish center Hillary Clinton and his elected judges.
Trump's campaigner told reporters that she had his words from the context and he never had any instigation of violence.
Bordini wants to recover the compensation from the organisers of the campaign for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines on the attack, the use of illegal guns and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump had not made his comments immediately.
It has failed to communicate with the Philippines.
WCCB, the Sharlote local news agency, is telling us that the Philippines has recently abandoned the campaign.
It has not been possible to call for a call by his consultancy firm "Innovative Consulting Services."
Donald Trump's presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition: a brand and sports holy in Kigmeat.
On Saturday, on Saturday, people gathered for the first time on Saturday.
After a decade of celebration this time, it was decided that Ezera's festive is no longer.
A new page is now converted.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the competition was not in the traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, the shots were to be met in the sleepers, the bot airport, the man left, 'bumbenches' have not been at all at the Olympic Games at all.
However, every member could show how strong, courageous, successful and attacking he was.
After sports games, all of the freells gathered in a freshness eagerness where the brigade began.
In the meantime, there was also a 'children's corner', where small people were able to disappear in efforts in efforts to find a new image in the sink of the sinks.
A new, which may also become a tradition, was a wheel debt in which both tractors and motorcycles were doomed.
All spoke of the head of the Governor, Inga Kadiķe-Skadina, who ordered a nice rest and droughts, but it was not very difficult to disturb anything.
The stories continued with the younger people to salute the youngest population.
Indeed, it is a good thing that the mess has been completed with five girls and one foot.
The wall of hot pockets had arisen from Engures from Engures to the spectators, a great pair of "Rudens", a defeat of the different peoples "Redas," and the "Golden Awards" of young people of young men and young people.
And that is nothing that the spectals were also trapped at the gate.
Of course, local people and the villages were happy with the famous void dug Janis Jaran and Dainis Porganism, who were once again a Milan Postal and a Cleante Krumina, as well as child soldiers from the fishermen's "Day."
The 'Bruble' group was in play.
Britain has to keep the Olympic gars and expand Hine.
It will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes the Hythrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we have invested a huge amount of work, so that all the country's regions would benefit from the Olympic Games.
It won an enormous amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again by providing local residents and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
We will create 10 000 new business opportunities for local communities alone, 40 000 new jobs and, finally, let us put an end to young people in the Hisseine area.
Just as the London Olympics in 2012, too, there will be people who will see that this challenge is too high and that the expansion of Hysis is too ambitious.
People then said that Britain would never succeed in the run-up to the Olympic Games and that it will be a global failure.
The cases were wrong for 2012, and they will not be right in the case of Heathrow.
There are always bottlenecks that have to be overcome, but Mortars have overcome everything to date.
Like the Olympic Games, Mortlands is an infrastructure project that will benefit society as a whole rather than individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating the ground for employment and experience in this airport and in the UK.
On Heathrow, a great team is working, which has created 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment in the infrastructure, within the timescales and budget, starting with a terminal 5, five years from the site as the best airport terminal in the world, and finally with a terminal 2 which is built between the two more intense roads in the world.
Now they are ready to build a third score that will be funded with private investment of 16 billion pounds.
The London Olympics 2012 was an excellent achievement, and I am sure that there will also be Hile enlargements.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and to expand Hine, ensuring our trade future and creating a new employment environment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deiton is a member of the Board of Heathrow, and former Minister for Commercial Affairs.
In Switzerland, the woman is saddened on a great track in trying to commit suicide.
The star night shook on the boat.
The police are trying to find a witness in an accident at the time of Thursday morning at a boat over a number of cars.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on A1 on the A1 route near Vo Canin.
According to the police report in the Vo Cann, the police were amazing to commit suicide, the woman had to go to the dark in the dark where there were several cars.
It is incomprehensible to try to kill, the victims, the victims of 49 year-olds, a number of cars, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
A number of accidents involved have already given testimonies to the drivers, while others have not yet clarified, say the police who are calling for the drivers and witnesses to respond.
The case has also been launched in criminal investigations, which is a logical step in this case, the edition of Le Tribune de Geneve said by a lawyer Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers said: "It will be clear to the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the past 5 years show that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrians in the night had gone to an excellent track, so it was decided that drivers cannot predict that the night will be a pedestrian, a newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was justified to be killed in the killing after the nearment in August 2014, when his man came to A1 near A1 near Payer.
The Court found that the 22 year-old victim was drunk and later noticed to sleep on the road.
The Court concluded that a police officer appearing on the road to an accident, in a proper manner and a judge, admitted that the sleep of a man on the road was "an unforeseeable and exceptional case."
Anyone who has information on the incident on Thursday Morges calls for contact with the police by 021 644 444 or 021 644 44.
The Internet has signed signatures for the organisation of a new head of the Revenue Service.
The collection of signatures from Avaaz.org on the ground for the organisation of the appointment of a new Head of State Service (Revenue Service).
In a petition addressed to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Greens / Farmers (Greens / Farmers), the Society wants the process of nominating transparent and professional officials.
On 10 August, the Penet was established on 10 August, and this is currently being signed by 55 people.
The process of nominating applicants for Revenue to the Director-General of the Revenue Service, Mrs Kolegova, is intransparent and non-professional.
It remembered the best traditions of the Soviet Union.
It is discrediting public administration and making society frustrated and politically discredited.
"It is necessary to compete on clear criteria to be judged by all candidates."
Its author has indicated that the Society is not aware of the criteria for the post of Kolegova.
Similarly, it was also not clear what the Revenue Service's incumbent will do.
On the Internet, the State Chancellery should form a new, open competition with active candidates, personalised selection specialists and an appropriate remuneration.
The Finance Minister, Dana Reiznieces-Ozola, officially designated for the post of Kolegova's head, to be approved in his new post this week, but all parties "Unity" voted against, therefore the issue of the week was postponed.
Samoilovs: If we lost, so I played a bad thing.
Mr Samoilovs, who was elected in Rio de Janeiro at the Rio Olympics, will have no difference, but Samoilovs had no difference at the end of the tournament.
One of the world's strongest beaches for the voyman's voyleyball is in a decisive and decisive game with 1-2 (16: 21, 22: 20, 7: 15) the Brazilian Evane Gonsalmon, Oliveira and Pee Solbergam, to conclude their participation in a four-year Sports Forum.
In the Trojos, the Latvian athletes win one win, but it was even more than two others.
Three of the small points of couples are counted on the following point, which, after the strongest possible loss of confidence in this mashal, was directly Latvia's duete.
The first six were under the top of the first six, but from 16: 15 to 16 points, the game remembered this morning.
I do not know, even I do not know, in the remaining part of the sixth, with no points.
It must not be.
After that, the second six were well on the agenda and were able to break the game in the agenda, and it should have been a good one for the third six.
That is what we started on, but after the parties have changed, the result was only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the group, all the teams were similar, almost all the matches were three six, so there were small points.
"You ought to be more similar, not to return 3-4 to four points in a row," the athlest said.
We were aware that the Evane can be preserved.
The first seemed to deal with it, 1-2 points, and the third to + 4 already played a game.
We tried to show the best game.
We came in, at times, I did not.
We were aware of the situation before the mask, but it was known that there was as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, so I played a bad thing," Samoilovs said.
We waited from the Evane to the good sertains, and the first six were also very good at the end, while the third opened the serve and it was hard to build an attack.
On the other hand, I made a great mistake to the Pee serves, but it was to deal with it.
Samoilovs said that, contrary to the previous mask, there was no nervousness to athletes.
"We walked up, the protection was, however, the protection was better, but it was better to welcome it," he said.
"They played well and came to the urry."
Before the moment, it was immediately said that it was the most uncompromising that might have been.
We also had the chance to fight for the first place, but not even out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for the medals and we also expected ourselves, but there is no longer any difference - 25.-place or 4th," said Samoilovs, who predicted that the dup will continue to play together in the future.
I believe that there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one turmoil.
In 2008, Samoilovam Rio was already in the third Olympic Truth's career, as in 2008 he played a total of four years in London with an Ruslanu Sorokina.
Meanwhile, this was the second start in the Olympic Truth.
Latvia will also be following the opening of the gas market with the process of opening up the gas market.
Latvia's energy company Latvia is following the opening of the gas market for the end of the gas market, the company's spokesman for Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether the gas market will join the gas market in the future as a trader will determine what the gas market model and the legal framework will be set up."
"That is why, on my side, we are actively involved in the drafting and comment of the legislative act, as well as the submission of its proposals," he added.
The Agency has already written to the BNS that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (EM), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulatory Commission and the Energy Companies' Latvijas Gaze ', developed the draft rules for the marketing and use of natural gas, which will change the existing principles of the natural gas market, from 3 April 2017 to ensure that natural gas users are free to choose the natural gas trader.
In dealing with the new market regulation for natural gas, EM shall aim to make the marketing process of natural gas as simple and user-friendly as possible.
For this reason, the most efficient and user-friendly solution is chosen "the central model of the trader," where all operations in connection with customer service provision are provided by the trader - one contract, one billing and a location for the provision of information and customer servicing, while at the disposal of the distribution system operator, in terms of the technical issue of the distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being put in place in electricity trade.
Recalling the gradual opening up of the market for household users, even after 3 April 2017 household customers who are not willing to choose other natural gas dealers will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming associated users.
"In that case, the obligation to supply natural gas to the users of the natural gas is designated by the public trader," the ministry informed.
On the other hand, operators will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a gas trade contract.

On the part of the return of the neighbouring countries, a man is in a printing ceiling and forced to leave their homes.
On LTV broadcast, the LTV broadcast took Dmitry Saidia, whose neighbour has started a capitalist repair in his apartment, and since then Dmitry of the Greeks bunker and it is not certain that they were safe to stay in a living.
The problem is that my neighbours have carried out arbitrary construction and that the Greeks have been damaged.
Then I informed the Riga construction Board, the House of the House of Houses and other Organisations.
The Steering Board said that we are not an operational service and no expert on us.
"The soldier must go into the Latvian Association of Engineers and there will be an expert from there," said Dmitry.
The invited expert has arrived, celebrated and recognised that the coverage was unsatisfactory.
However, since the first Dmitry on the construction board of Dmitry, a month has passed since and, by the beginning of this week, it has also failed to answer whether there is no living in living conditions.
It has been said in the building rule - that is legislation, waiting, if you are not happy, write for everyone.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they were sending a house manager, then the house manager once again on the building board, and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry said.
After all paper screening, it is clear that construction works are halted, even if it is possible to hear that someone is working there.
In a further two months, an expert should be carried out and the owner of a resident for a period of six months for repairing all these defects should be prevented.
The Independent Expert has developed its opinion, but the building board is considered to be incomplete and superficial.
The experts have not indicated whether the metal of metal contained in this non-soluble structure is affected, so there is no assurance that the subcontracting owner is being threatened.
"That is why we have asked for an additional explanation from this expert," Mr Ilze Zhka, a representative of the Riga City Council.
Despite the ban on any repairs to the top fitness, there is still an ever hearing that construction continues.
The penalty for unsolicited construction is between 70 and 700 euros without construction, but the penalty can be much more severe.
As long as the opinion of the expert is pending, the construction board has decided that both of them should not be exploited, both for construction works and for Dmitry.
"This is a case in practice in the construction board, where it has been possible, in such a way, because of its incompetence or simply by unwillingness, to jeopardise not only its own property, but also the subproperty owners, which may not operate their property," the spokesman for the hosting board.
Now the Dmitry has to look for another place where to live - to the relatives, friends, hotels or rent others.
But the losses incurred by Dmitry can be pushed back from a neighbour to a civilian legal basis, which can take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction of both habits, it is now forbidden, until the engineer gives its conclusion, and may have to wait even three weeks.
The loss suffered will have to be borne by the resident owner in which repairs have taken place.
This residential owner is due to the fact that the construction of the construction board has not been taken into account, also at risk of imprisonment for up to six months.

NASA Climate Model: Venera, once a populated planet
On the basis of the newest climate models of NASA, the Venera has once been a populated planet.
The NASA Godarda Space Study Institute has developed a model to explore the Venera's history through tools and algorithms using climate scientists as well.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, the surface of which is hot where there is no water and that the atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, which is once the case for the earth.
Researchers have mentioned earlier that the slow pace of the Venera's slowness is due to the density of the atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation shows that Venera has ever been a plan, a earth similar to the earth and it has turned slowly.
The Modelis also looks at the past topography of Venus.
The planet has had more dry areas than on earth, but it has been sufficiently waterborne and geographically diverse, in order to be able to form life and prevent water from evaporating.
In early childhood, the sun was 30 per cent.
In the simulated model of the GISS model, the Venusy Return model reveals that the daily rest of the day for its duration is 2 months, explaining Mr Del Genio in a press release.
This process presents the surface of a warm planet and raises a case which, in turn, is a rainfall of clouds, acting as an umbrella, to protect the planet from the sun heat.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is emerging, which is actually a few degrees lower than the earth today.
Modelis image Venera's history, which is a similar evolution to the evolution that scientists have drawn up in their hypotheses.
Although once it has been inhabitable, the Venera has been subject to too much heat and ultraviolet races over a period of several billion years.
Its oceans displayed off the ocean and the rains were buried off the ultraviolet ray.
The water, in full light, is only a plan for carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas - Venera as we know it today.
Researchers published the results of the new Venus climate model magazine Geophysical Research Letters.
Parliament's position on the Commission proposal
On Thursday, Colleagt coach and hockey Operation Vice-President Patrik Roy submitted a request for his / her team's decision.
Vice President and Director-General of Colorado said the news was confirmed and reported that the club would start search for new coaches as a matter of urgency.
"For the last three years, I have been vigorously, enthusiastic and purposeful to perform his duties as the head coach and the Colombian team," Roy said in his statement.
During this summer, I have had a lot of thinking about how I could improve the performance of the team in order to give it the necessary bribery and to achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the main trainer and the hockey to the Vice-President of the Office should be fully in line with the organisation's vision.
He should also be able to influence decisions concerning team performance.

North Sea oil platforms restart negotiations and postpone strike
Workers' strikes on the salaries of the North Sea oil platforms have been postponed because negotiations are resumed at both sides of the dispute by the negotiators.
The "Wood Group" takes a strike on the North Sea oil platforms operating in the "Royal Dutch Shell."
The joint statement states that the "Wood Group" and "Unite" and "RMT" trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations on the resolution of the dispute.
A series of full days in the coming weeks will begin at the beginning of next week in order to reconsider the issues of concern.
The trade unions stated that their recent measures organised after more than 25 years of interruptions are targeted at 30 percent of the salary cuts.
The 'Wood Group' reduced salaries in the North Sea to 9 per cent this year due to the unusual market pressure.
For 2014, the company reduced the salary of 10 percent of the workers to the terrestrial workers.
The company explains that the additional wage cuts would enable the company to survive the recession.
The Sahel has already reduced many thousands of people and announced plans to halt oil and gas activities in 10 countries to optimise their work in the run-up to a large-scale mergers with the British Energy Companies "BG Group."
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is even more complicated by the British decision to leave the European Union.
Speaking at the beginning of the week, Deivus Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues: the North Sea strikes plans.
He said that the North Sea is vitally important to the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the state as a whole need an economy that would benefit all and not individual individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects provide for investment of almost USD 1.4 billion, compared to USD 7 billion invested over the last five years.
Keep up the star steak of the Keep trees in a star star.
The latest Keep's telescope mission has helped to collect astronomers summarising the fullest catalogue over the speed of the benches of the stars in a star star in the astronomy.
The new data assists astronomers to understand why the stars in this star come to different speed, as well as the way in which the Greening 'ceiling is to be attributed to the planet.
"We hope that when we compare our results with other stars, we will get more information about the link between the mass of the star, the age and even the history of its sun," the world news spokesman said Luisa Caltech infrastructure and Analytical Centre Luisa Rebula.
The star of a star is over 445 years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this star have only started to grow to around 125 million years old.
They turn up at a maximum speed.
When it comes to the maximum speed, the star star shot a large amount of star winds.
They put the brakes on the magnetic fields and put the brakes on the stars.
Fresh astes are shrinking, cutting the ceiling.
Keep every stars at the speed of setting the time between the appearance of an identifiable star area such as the sun plantations.
The latest stars of the Greening Greeks show that more stars are slow down than the smaller stars.
The Rebull compares the star with a wear, more of the fertilisers are making blowers more cheaply than low fertilisers.
The rebuster tells us that the benches show that the cheaply rotating objects are larger and massively, while the sooner royal objects are very small stars.
It is thanks to the star of a star, that is as close as it is, it serves as a great space laboratory to compare the characteristics of stars to the Greeks.
The leader tells us that a plea star helps to build theoretical models for the rotation in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why we will slow down the Greening speed of stars and the full process of entering it.
The bubble and his colleagues have presented a detailed analysis of the speed of the benches of the star stars in three new publications, which will be published shortly at the Astronomic Journalists.

a 28-year-old boy found dead in the San Francisco supermarket
a 28-year-old boy, who recently moved to San Francisco this week, was a dead letter of 28 years old.
, the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone who would like to go over his brother saying that 'His life finally started to improve'.
, who was on Wednesday at the Westpfield supermarket, was identified as a 28-year-old Frenck Galicia, a spokesman from the San Francisco Courch Office of the San Francisco Courch Office.
The San Francisco police said his death was declared a murder and an investigation is under way.
Luiss Galicia told San Francisco José Manuel Barroso that he had previously worked as a boat in Boston, but six months ago, he was on his dream in Sanfrancs in the restaurant on Son & Daughters.
Restaurants Sons & Daughters said they shocked them and shocked them.
"We are a small team working as a frozen family and we will miss him very much," he said.
In these difficult times, we share our thoughts with the friends of the Queen and with the family.
Peter Galicia tells him at the beginning he was nasty in the hostele, but recently, life had finally improved.
"He came to a new apartment and met with a girl," he told the KGO radio station.
Luiss Galicia claims he does not know who would like to go over his younger brother.
He was a good man with a great heart.
"He has always missed his family, preparing a spiritful meal and preparing for dinner," said Luiss Galicia.
He never wanted to enter into disputes.
He was a brother who had adapted to the others.
"In the face of everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamonan who died every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the incident is invited to call on the SFD hotline 415-575-4444.
New doctors strike: call for new protests
Representatives of the new doctor ask their trade union to launch protests in the dispute over the new treaty.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Doctors Committee (JAK) intends to ask the Council to support more protests in early September.
The JAK feels that ministers failed to address doubts about the Treaty.
In July, the new doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
For the first time, 58% of the total turnout was voted against.
In a message published Thursday evening on Twitter, JUKAN board member Estina McCort said that the government remained silent on this issue and that the offer of the contract had therefore been rejected.
She said, 'In light of this, the vote in the JUKIP has resulted in a complete rejection of the offer of a contract and a decision to call for new formal negotiations to discuss the main issues'.
In response to the silence of the government, the JAK has today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the development of new agreements that would enter into force in September.
The dispute resulted in young doctors taking part in six strikes, including, for the first time, the work of NHS in the history of NHS.
Following the vote rejecting the contract terms offered by LMA, which was recommended in the BMA, a new doctor from the LMA's new doctor, Dr Johnawana, resigned.
Ahead of a meeting with 54 000 new doctors and medical students, he had told MPA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, the Secretary of State, James Harantor, said the contract would be concluded with English mediators.
Russia and Turkey: The alliance of exclusion?
A pity that brought the crisis to an end.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to see and announce the end of the eight-month war on words and economic sanctions.
On the other hand, Vladimir Putin welcomes Turkey's leader in St Petersburg, giving the impression that this partnership is more necessary in Ankara.
They both shook.
Vladimir Putin was smarter and did not provoke warm emotions, even in the light of his customary deterrence.
Reunion Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, called Putin the "dear friend" at least five times.
I felt a number of people.
He went on to say that "relations with Russia will not only improve to pre-crisis levels but will become even stronger."
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan has been approached as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm gives rise to controversial feelings.
However, the thread irradiated from Putin has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his address was the removal of Russian planes at the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin denounced Ankara for sticking to Moscow's backs.
It was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true confidence will be very difficult, maybe impossible.
Since November, Russia's public stance has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television has spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious was the accusations that the Erdogan himself had made a profit from illegal oil trade with the Islamic State controlled by the Islamic State.
He himself, of course, denied this.
However, the key message of the Saint Petersburg Summit is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting happened just because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could take it a sort of victory.
Ankara's gains from peace reconciliation are obvious.
First of all, Erdogan needs every possible friend in the wake of the coup last month in which he tried to overthrow.
The numerous terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
The economic motives are also there.
Russian sanctions have led to substantial losses, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually leads to several millions of Russian tourists entering Turkish ports each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian haulturers and charter companies will also relax lightly when scheduled flights are renewed.
They expect leave on the middle of the season in the Mediterranean.
As long ago as this week, public TV provides for a fall in the price of fruit and vegetables, as imports of Turkish fruit and vegetables will be restored.
Local newspaper Vejonis quoted: "The tourists, Tomatoes for us."
The visit, however, had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West as, in their view, the weak response to the coup attempt.
One can also see the frustration with the lengthy negotiations on accession to the EU and Putin's intervention, which is eager to take advantage of the situation of Turkey alienating from the West.
The Russian leader has doubtless obtained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for its elected government after the coup.
Note that Moscow is well aware of this, because its own fear of regime change is deep-rooted.
The summit that took place in this luxury pieboard gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as some analysts, the 'excluded Alliance', two states that feel excluded from the West join forces.
However, despite public demonstrations, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a weapon of peace, but in fact Russia and Turkey are supporting the opposite side.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, and without wishing to disclose information, the two presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey resolutely avoided the issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus as to how the two countries could find a common language on Syria.
However, after months of openly hostile relations and potential catastrophes when a NATO member Turkey buried the Russian battle plane, the situation has improved because both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
Scotland's Royal Bank will no longer be open to all Scottish customers
The CCB will continue to play a supporting role in future, said the Bank's Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, the SKA will no longer be available.
Rose Macroan told the BBC channel in Scotland that the ICB's brand was associated with a bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions as, eight years ago, the bank almost went bankrupt and was in need of financial assistance.
Meanwhile, the brand strategy experts have used the ICB's brand to protect other consumers' financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, starting with Six's regeneration and at the end of the Nimblebia tennis champion.
However, it has now been decided to put other national brands at the forefront.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be institutionalised.
In England and Wales, all references of the SKB, outside the central office and the official exchange rate, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already being used in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Less private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also benefit now.
The room was interviewed during the trip with clients and staff per Inverigshire.
He wrote to the BBC Scottish Channel: "The ICC will become our investor brand with which our employees work, because now we become more than a brand bank."
In time the bank itself became a global brand and the ICC became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambition; we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in our industry and our employees will be working with their customers under those brands.
The ICB has already announced that it will not continue sponsorship of the United Nations and that it will involve a variety of brands in the sponsorship of sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank because we have long been asking ourselves how to become a better bank for their customers?"
Three years ago, it would have been highly cynical for us to declare itself to be a great bank for our customers and to develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on customer needs and not on our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
Once again we can revive these brands, so I think now is the right time.
Frank Deme won the 3000th win with the first place in New Newcastle with horse Preamection
The reactors kid the champagne by invoking their 3000th victory at the first race in Newcastle.
On Friday, Joke Frank Deme won the 3000th win in the history of Britain, taking the first place in New Newcastle.
He achieved this by invoking the second victory in the race that took place in his home town, in the face of Presection, which had been coached by George Gosine.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth flock that has reached the races of a horse race.
He has joined Seram Gordon Riikardgh, Dougam Smitam, Lester Pigota, Peter Ebet and William Karson.
The annual champion jocmaker Desks, who won the horse Ghayyar beforehand, said, 'This is something special'.
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that this has happened in Newcastle, because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not Royal AScota, but a normal Friday night with 20 000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
In the aftermath of the victory, the reactors and the Presection are welcome and light.
The two fences have reached this record with obstacles: the world champion Rihards Johnson and the finishing 20-times champion Sir Antony Mackoi, who has set up several records in his career, fighting over 4 300 wins.
Lester Pigni, who served as a winner, has won 4 493 victory during his career.
The Frenchy is one of the world's best fighters, and it is no surprise that he has achieved a success that only the rare earth can achieve.
He is strong and powerful, but his sense of tactics is separated by her from other fences.
He is a fantastic racing spokesman, his enthusiasm and charharma are attracting fans for years for this type of sport.
A few weeks ago, I told the Frenchy a few weeks ago that he had already won 6.000 victory if he did not take part in the weekend and the big race.
However, to be serious, it is a real pleasure that the Frenchman has regularly won over 30 years in the UK's races.
He is a life spectator who flies perfectly in British races, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Destrom noted this achievement with his firm sign, the flight slot.
Out of the wind speed up to the flight, Frank Dec has been the face of a British horse race for twenty years.
This has been a passion for adventure.
He has won a dozen massacres, including the famous Great Apprentice in Askit 1996, and has also survived the plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he was difficult to return after six months' disqualification, but he demonstrated his political strength by challenging those who questioned him by returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for some time - the tors previously said that they would have liked to continue participating in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin dismisses the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanovs has been in the clothes of Putin for many years.
The 60-year-old politician has now been appointed Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
According to the Kremlin's statement, Putin has decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian President, "without giving any reason.
Iliana Ivanova, who had been Deputy Assistant since 2012.
The 44 year-old Waino has been a diplomat.
Waino was born in Tallinn in 1972, graduated from the Prestige Institut for International Relations of the Moscow National Institution (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As the Kremlin's homepage (Russian) says, he later led to the President's protocol and the government's staff management.
After his appointment he said, "Thank you for your confidence."
I think that the main job of the administration is to support your work as President of the State in drafting the law and monitoring the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov wants to leave office and recommendation Waino as his substitute.
Do you convince the smiles?
This step confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked together in the Soviet security service, KGB.
In his capacity, he was one of the most powerful men in Russia.
As reported, the two men announced that Ivanov resigned on his own initiative.
But notwithstanding the smiles on the cameras, it rarely tends to reassure us, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is that the result of the power struggle?
Nobody knows.
However, the official claim that the man who was considered a possible President suddenly wanted to be chief of the Russian environment policy is treated with great scepticism.
In the remarks published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says: 'It is a fact that, at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust this difficult position, perhaps a challenging position, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in office for four years and eight months.
Ivanovs entered the office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the National Security Service of the KGB, just like Putin.
At the end of the 1990s Putin led the Federal Security Service, the successor of KGB, Ivanov took over his deputy position.
When Putin came to power he called Ivanov among the five people with whom he trusted the most.
At the end of the second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the presidential candidate, as Putin's re-election to the third term would be unconstitutional.
At the time, however, another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became President.
Putin has become a prime minister and has been returning to President after three and a half years.
Arrival of blended fish in a garden in Banfu
One man from Banfan asks for help to find out what species fish have appeared in his garden in Banfia.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sandware flowing with waterboats.
Mr Beina, who lives around 500 metres of the sea, was released on the fish video website of PerisScope, hoping that someone could know how those 5 centimetres of fish had gone into his garden.
This juncture of wine: the bridge is now connected to Faife.
The EUR 1.35 billion project is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the north and the vibrid juncle of the cannon farm, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faife.
The first of the four connecting chapters has been completed, which means that the building of the bridge is nearing completion.
The structure of a seam bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It is made up of 10,000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
A projected 1.35 billion pound is planned for May 2017.
Economic secretary Keit Brown has today travelled to the building site and was one of the first to step down to the bridge.
He said, 'This is a symbolic and historic moment in building a bridge between the Queensue bridge'.
In this project, we see an unworkable engineering solution, where only the construction of this part represents more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weights and dimensions of the bridge, the connection between bridges and viadrix is an extremely delicate process that requires immense precision.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge has already been built and the final stage linking the bridge to Rositu will be curbed today, which means that parts of the bridge are ready for entry.
"First connectivity is a very important point in building any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link demonstrates the construction of first-class engineering.
After the final road stage was installed and coupled with the support of the northern tower, we were forced to link the northern road section with the landmark or viaduke.
This was done by shifting the 700 millimetres from the northern crossroads to the south.
It was a huge, at the same time, very delicate operation.
It is huge, because the viadrix is 222 metres long, weighs around 6 000 tonnes and had to degenerate by around 3%.
Policate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything worked well.
Simona Baysa collects gold for women.
Continuous tension.
It is disturbing.
Simone Bayfor does not bother about this.
Dinnamic sentiment.
Efforts shall be made to exercise restraint on the plank.
Do not be capable of floating.
Absolutely!
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American film won the gold medal, demonstrating completely the difference between itself and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
Her overall number of 62,198 litists fell far short of the output of the silver medal and the result of her team beet Al Raismanes and the result of Age Mubarreich, the Russian sportspeople for the bronze medals.
On Thursday, US sportspeople Simona Bailsa made a celebration at the weekend of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bail became the fourth international man to win the Championship title and the fifth best exercise, gradually strengthening reputation as the best exercise in his generation and perhaps the best exercise.
When the end result was announced, she escaped sharply because the long road was over at the moment.
This achievement ranks him next to unworkable athletes like Michael Felps, who picked up his sport at another level.
Bail has dominated the past three years in the form of sport with 15 medals in the world championships, including 10 gold medals, and the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lu Reton, called him the "best exercise ever seen by him."
In Brazil he was faced with the last test, where she had to compete to a large extent with the hopes placed on him and not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Judge, Texas, without the gold medals.
Simona Baille (left) and Alija Raismane also flooded in the scene of a sports exercise in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The first gold medal in Bailsa was won on Tuesday by making the Marta Karolji Catholic of special random.
Though Bayls claims that he had long been waiting for the massacre, it was not true.
A part of her preoccupation during the free movement, which includes her special acroic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which fits perfectly well on the streets beside the Olympic Games.
This is no coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby and was discovered by the mother of the tree Eimary Burman in excursion in the field of sport, where the Heathes triumph was held, has now become the force to be taken into account.
She has not lost a multi-level playing field since summer 2013 and a series of victory may continue as long as the Bayla wants it.
Although Mustaunch was somewhat in the lead at the time of two rotation, it was an illusion.
The balance of balance and the free movement - part of the competitions where Bail will champion its champions - is still ahead of us.
She came to the front with a result of 15.433 on the timber and strengthened the management with effect from 15.933 free movements
Raismane waited her mildly while she expected results, which was a mere formality and she flooded the dream that she had once had written into his book books.
The outcome of Raismine was a slight retaliation of four years of events when she shared the third place with Mubarreich, but lost the fight for the bronze medals.
This time, the 22-year-old team's captain, called the Americans' grandmother ', was put forward with convincing leadership.
She was able to dedicate her to the air father's crowd, following an outreach in free movements that dispelled doubts about her return.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old Baille virus on Twitter, which she published this week, is now completely different.
The 6 year old, Mahai Brash, lives in a shell in Philadelphia.
Police said 6 years old was shot in Philadelphia, pointing out that it was already the second sixteen year shot in Philadelphia this week.
A child's grandparents CBS Philadelphia news station has confirmed that it is Mahai Brauns.
Parents say Brown has been shot several times, including in the compartment, the legs, the hand and the cool, but there was still consciousness when he was moved to the hospital.
His grandmother, Deloresa MAendeza, said on TV: "His little body was simply loose."
I cannot believe it.
The boy is in a critical condition and has already suffered several operations.
The family says he will certainly recover.
He had to start to first class at the local primary school.
Drive is one of the four people shot dead in the town of Jersey.
Three men were also shot: two men of 29 years old and 1 21-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one in 29 year olds is in a critical condition, while the condition of the remaining two victims is stable.
The canal says that a child was found on the front seat of the car following a critical condition of 29 years old.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of them was attacked.
CBS Philadelphia said that a number of piles were likely to be involved in shooting.
A weapon cartridle of weapons belongs to a weapon instead of a mess.
It seems to have been a long-standing shelling.
There were shellites on both sides of the pedestrian scene.
"It seems that there have been several armed murders here who actively participated in the shooting," Antony Ginaldi, captain of the Philadelphian police, told Filadelphian police captain.
The damage was also caused by several homes and cars.
No one has ever been detained and the police are reported to check the recording of observation cameras.

Why do we need Simona, Gabon and Lauria?
I call it the Year of Women's Olympics, Vieglata Komanda, for a number of reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all the summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three light bullets, Simona Bailsa, Gabon Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, inspired by many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that Alija Raismane, a Catholic, is also a member of Alija Raismane.
Finally, this team genuinely representations America.
It has also strengthened the presence of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best exercise is the Americas of Africans.
Last year Simona and Gabon took 1 and 2 seats.
These are impressive results.
Outside the Olympics, Gabriel Duglasa became, surprisingly, the Olympic champion, and America was able to lead.
The world has now seen incredible exercise by the triple world champion Simona Bailsa, Duglasa and Laurija Hernandeza, carrying out unprecedented, but masterious, exercise.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth international man to win the gold medal in the individual struggle against women.
Her team, Alija Raismane, won the silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but in the rest of the country, the situation in the exercise is completely different.
Simona, Gabon and Lauria were in the Olympic team just like Alia and Medisona.
They are the Olympic Games, because the next Olympic exercise will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year of the third year of the Marta Karola.
In fact, exercise is an expensive sport; the ingroteers are mainly trained in private cars and are kept by parents who pay for training, spaces, trips, formafixes, hotels (coaches, athletes and their families) and other expenditures.
Most of these light bulbs are located in urban districts which can afford this sport.
In these clubs, sportspeople are driving all their coaches, and this is a costly and long investment for millatant families.
Eimija Bangman - Simone Baycus and Megija Hainen - Laurian Hernandez coach, has been training his sportspeople since the two girls started to go to light.
We need to provide young girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabon and Lauria for cheaper exercise.
I founded my light organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is in Harare, and we are offering more than 15 000 towns for exercise, free of charge or at low prices, for young people (mainly black and Spanish), and we have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my home town) to provide local young people with the opportunity to get to know this splendid sport.
Lobvirooms develop the coordination of forces, of the loyalty and of the body, and they teach hard work, discipline and ambition.
This combination secures a long life with good health and success, both at school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to train in milliletics, and that is fantastic.
It is very important to deal with this type of sport, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Alija, Gabon and Medison for the splendid demonstration of the 'Wheel Force', giving up the gold medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young, diverse girl girls to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After the rejection of his offer, young doctors plan to take more strikes.
Ministers expected an end to the disagreement by reaching agreement on changes to the treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who participated in the vote rejected it.
In July, the Hahn announced plans to conclude a contract saying that the NHS is in a precarious position and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for a change in the conditions of night work and weekends in order to improve working conditions in non-standard working hours.
Last night, Dr Estina Makota, a spokeswoman for the new doctors, said that the new doctors still had serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, in particular that it would deepen the labour crisis and do not provide for equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks before the first group of new doctors sign the new treaty, so progress must be made, because time is running out.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the problem have been confronted with a lack of willingness on the part of the government, and sometimes with total silence.
This was despite the fact that, last month, James Hants said that his door was always open.
Jaory Hanun must take immediate action, stop inaction and work with the new doctors.
If he fails to do so, the new doctors are ready for new protests.
During the last strike, over 13 000 raids and 100 000 visits were postponed at the end of April, while nurses and consultants attempted to replace cannon doctors.
Ministers expected an end to the disagreement by agreeing an agreement to change the treaty with the British Medical Association.
The BMA wishes to raise the rate of weekend work for 54 000 new doctors subject to new contracts.
Daniels Mortimer, CEO of NHS, called on young doctors not to take industrial action.
Mr Mortimera explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only raise the pressure on congested workers and worry, cause stress and hinder patients, carers and their families.
We have been talking with the new medical committee over the last two months and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions on fathers and whistleblowers.
Employers expect active cooperation on other key issues, such as staff placement, flexible training, additional training for returning after career breaks, training costs, school drop-out and health inequalities in medicine - which shows that employers, the Health Ministry of England and the Health Ministry are serious about realising the agreements concluded with BME in November, February and May.
Medicinal products on a daily basis can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart of heart could be treated by 2 pounds per day because official representatives recommend them to be used for more people and for a longer period of time.
The anti-recalling drug in Ticagreor reduces the nucleus risk of people with carriages.
These medicines are already prescribed for use 12 months after the heart of the heart, reducing the risk of a re-use.
NICE, which is represented by NHS, recommended 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of heart and cardiovascular problems for people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE, under the responsibility of NICE, is currently recommending that this preparation be used for a period of 4 years after the heart, in order to further reduce cardiovascular risks.
Every year, approximately 140 000 people in England are in a heart of conscience, a quarter of which face a repeat of their heart or insult.
My heart and insult are the accumulation of fatty acids in cardiovascers through dams.
If the dam burst, it can cause thrombin by blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart of heart.
On the other hand, if thrombin divides from cardiovascular walls, it can go further into blood and block blood to the brain, leading to a heart attack.
People who have had a heart of conscience are at greater risk of reheartening.
The icurelor produced by the British firm AstraZeneca, traded under the name Bridque, reduces the risk of thrombin being created.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people use 90 mg Ticagurelor for 12 months and another 3 years of 60 mg twice a day, together with aspirin.
NICE Health Technology Director Professor Kerola Longsons said: "Despite the availability of medication to prevent the repetition, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack are going through another heart or stroke which often has serious consequences."
Fear of reheartening can have a negative impact on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagurelor, combined with aspirit, effectively reduces the risk of a repeat of the heart of the heart and heart of the people who have experienced it.
By provisionally recommending treatment to Ticagreor, we are happy that we can extend treatment opportunities to the thousands of people who are thus winners.
In the light of the limited information on the efficiency and safety of Ticagurelor, in particular the risk of blending, using this medicinal product for more than three years, the draft guidelines shall not recommend that it be used for more than that period.
A culture of political correctness contributes to fraud during election in Muslim communities
According to the management report, former Mayor of Tauern, Lutfuran Rahman, was dismissed as a result of corruption.
The government's report reveals that political correctness culture has turned a blind eye to large-scale fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eriks Heikl has criticised the police, the election monitors and the city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud during the electoral process as "afraid to touch on ethnic and religious interests."
The former communist party, who has now become a leader of anti-corruption organisation, says that intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so widespread that the police should be allowed to deploy guards near the election stations in order to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a identity document when they vote to prove their real identity.
At present only the name and address shall be indicated by the voters.
He is even recommending the purchase of voter voters with special heirs in order to avoid double voting.
Whistleblowers must also be given greater protection, says Sir Eriks.
He is of the opinion that the press must have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working parties.
He says: 'The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect local authorities from a wider culture of corruption and fraud that goes hand in hand with it'.
The report was commissioned in Dauningstuff following a scandal in connection with the city of Tauern.
Last year, a special electoral court decided to remove the mayor Lutfuran Rahman from a mayor's office for corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found Rahman's' cynical misrepresentation 'of the religious viewpoint of his Muslim community and concealed his critics by accusing them of racism and islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign saying that the religious duty of believing Muslims is to vote for him."
Around 300 votes were falsified or dubious because one person had voted several times.
Sir Eriks also notes that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He said that "voting by post" is particularly worrying, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their preferred candidate.
Sir Erich recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including identification of identity documents, in order to find out a person's identity.
His report says: "Evidence suggests that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for the oldest candidates of communities, especially in Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities."
"There is a fear that district institutions do not pay heed to these problems due to political correctness, as they might offend ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Erica set out 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with votes cast by post in order to prevent "votes harvesting."
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists in the field of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to produce an identity document before voting.
Incorporating the purchasing of votes cast by voters with special heated in order to avoid double voting.
The systematic verification of the nationality of persons in order to ensure that the person is entitled to vote.
Separate three years for requests for automatic voting by correspondence.
To deny political campaigners and activists work with votes cast by correspondence and electoral collots for vote by correspondence.
Ensure the police the power to appoint a guard at the polling stations.
To make changes to the law to make it easier for individuals to be brought to justice for fear under the 1983 Convention of Human Rights.
Putting photographs on the polling stations.
Use only English (except Wales) for polling stations.
Increase training so as to ensure that combuses get to the ballot box one by one.
Sir Erich strongly criticises the Metropoles police, saying it did not understand that there was no accusations levelled at the Taut hampere case.
He says: "The election court only disqualified Lufusu Rahman and his representative on the activities associated with corruption and fraud."
He was strongly declared guilty according to the standard evidence of criminal law on the basis of irreproachable evidence.
He also criticises the inefficient 'scrutiny' of voters in the city council at the polling stations.
The decision taken last year by Sir Erich is a wake-up call.
Our land is known to be the homeland of parliament, but the alarming and hidden proliferation of electoral fraud and the pretence of the authorities that fraud does not put this good repute at risk.
Disability with cyclists - Assistant Assistant and other Rio Olympics
The 2016 Rio Olympics fans enthusiastically welcome the French blator, Pauline Ferrando Prevota, who has been recognised by the fans as extremely similar to Cambridge.
However, a 24-year-old bicycle is not the only athleman struggling for gold this summer, which, as the media writes, boasts for his famous counterpart.
Therefore, instead of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that we are seeing in our screens, FEMAIL has set up a list of members of the Olympic Games that are similar to the Holivuda star.
Medal and vilk: Breidy Elison, spokesman for the U.S. Art Art, on the left, compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio
Apart from Mrs Keith's contribution to the bicycle trail, many people on the Internet point out that this logo could be a superstar Leonardo Di Kaprio's brother.
Brevili Ellisha, a member of the US Journley team, gave a storm on Twitter when the photographs were published, where he was very close to Wincontroversy Vila.
The athletes also noticed a storm in social media and admitted that she had been compared with Mário David Caprio since childhood.
"I see no great similarities, with the exception of the beard," Ciffington Post said in a statement.
"He's a looking shing, so I take it as a compliment."
This year, one of the most popular couples of London Olympics in 2012 is undoubtedly going to be even more popular: the shocking equation between the British far-flyer, Gregu Rterforwards and the popular actor Nile Patric Harare.
The Russian light Alija Mustafina, thanks to his great enthusiastic eyes, is being compared with Gloria Estefou, an American singer of Cuban origin.
South Africa swim Kamerons van der Burg has been compared for many years with the stars of Metju Morison for several years.
Change: This user noticed that it is the actress' actress' of the Inserver.
Nadal, tennis star and actor Jos Harsen have similar stats and lips.
The Russian silver medalle, bait Yulia Efimova and actress Annaline McCorda can be proud not only of the matched skin and blonde hair; meanwhile, the anathful US athlete, Nurans Adrians, likes Dr Gordon Levitam.
Women are being shot: Football stars (left) Houter Solo and Serial "Decreasury" actress Jeniferai Karpenana (right) have a similar form and eyes.
There is no one: a Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others see these similarities as well.
Terence: This user considers that there may well be grounds for both appealing
Recently, a Twitter user noticed with great pleasure that "other internet users shared the view that Houpa Solo and Jenifera Karpenter were actually on the same footing."
The US football stars and the Serial "Decreasury" are indeed a very similar form and eyes of the faces.
Other popular comparisons pertain to Kerr Wenze and her smile, which is almost identical to the smiles of actress Laura Linz, and his gold medal, Gabriel Duglasa, is proud of a beautiful, extensive smile similar to Bring It on the smiles of Gabriel Unijon.
The commentator of the CBC Olympic Games apologises for the comment that the Chinese bag is dead as a pig '.
Bairona Makdonalda's analysis of the 4x200 m lethal wave at the four-year-old Fi Yanhas finishes was a storm in the viewers of the CBC.
The Canadian channel BBC has been forced to apologise, as one of its commentators commented that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "departed from the contest, that he was ridiculing" and "dead as a pig."
His microphone was switched off when 4x200 m of unfestile marphets presented their personal views at the end of the finer.
The donor, who was included in the CBC commentators' team, said: "This small fourteenth birthday cannot keep up with her."
"He went away from the race to sleep alone and ended up as a pig."
Thank you very much.
Ai Yanhana, 14-year-old, was in the second stage of 1: 57.79, which is 1.61 seconds lower than the outcome of Canado Rucca, allowing Canadians to catch up with China.
The audience throughout Canada responded immediately over the Internet because it was shocking to hear such tone and expressions.
Emets Makfarlain wrote on Twitter: 'Do the direct CBC commentator just say that the 14-year old' Chinese 'ended up as a pig???. "
He did not understand that they were still in the direct ether.
Ai Yanha from China's 4x200m freelance has been named as a 'small fourteenth birthenth' from China.
The criticism against Baironu Makdonalda was swiftly adopted, as many requested clarifications.
Twitter's users were not able to believe when I hear Bairona Makdonalda's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sar Paradi wrote: "Oho, #Byron Macald.
As a representative for the CBC and Canada, and for now, we all sound like racist.
Shortly after that, Scotland Russell, who was steered by the CBC, apologised for the comments by Makdonalda by saying: 'We apologise that the comment on the grey result was depicted into a direct ether'.
This was a misguided choice of words and we very much regret that.
The CBC apologised to over 90 people who had reacted on Twitter.
My colleague, Scotland, had to apologise for his place.
Then the CBC poured an apology for over 90 Twitter users complaining of the comment made by Mr Makdonalda.
An apology and a statement was also quickly issued by the Canal.
We very much regret that such comments have been made and they reached a direct ether.
Yesterday we immediately reacted and apologised to all the viewers and followers of the social media.
In the interests of clarity, Bairona's comments were made as a singer's performance, not addressed to her personally.
However, they were, in any case, unprofessional and unfortunate, and Bairons deeply regrets what has happened.
On Thursday afternoons, McDonald personally apologised to the directly ether and tried to explain that he did not think his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
"I would like to use the moment and apologise for the comment that I said yesterday following the women's free style competition."
I am talking about the greening performance, not about him personally.
Needless to say, I did not intend to pay disrespect and I really regret that.
The buyers of the Guimarães are shocked by a woman who is shamelessly subtracted in the middle of subjells.
The shoppers felt uncomfortable when a woman started to dressed to catch them in the shops.
To make matters worse, she did so to see if they were behind her and then drowned them by putting bicks back into a shop shelf.
She continued to look for the clothes in the Folkeston Bouverie Place shop in the shop and opened another four bicks.
Guimarães in the Folkeston Place of Bouverie Place, the place where the woman stood up and then put it back on the shelf.
At the time there were also two children's mother, George Devividson, who tells us that the unknown woman drew his clothes and left the store by leaving nothing.
She points out that people were unable to believe their own eyes.
In the middle of a shop, she picked up the shelves underfoot, took off my zegdours and bicks and then seized them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them; she simply drove them out on the spot.
Everybody looked at how she took off the bicks and obviously did not like the woman because she simply put them back on the shelf.
She picked three more bicks until she decided that she did not like him and left the shop.
I did not think he would worry you would watch or think of a man who bought the clothes she had given.
The workshop of Davidmen (33 years) from Kenya said: "The idea is that somebody bought the clothes that have been burned by another person and then have not been washed."
The incident was held on Tuesday afternoon.
I suppose the employees of the shop took out these clothes from the shop shelves after she went away - which is also acceptable. "
I cannot imagine that you could buy a new subjet and find out that another woman has taken time and then has not washed.
The Guimarães said he was aware of an incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
The particular clothes have been taken off the shelves.
How to protect ourselves from firearms by Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in close distance from the aggressors with a firearm, we talked to Krav Maga, from New York Ronan Mizraki.
Whether you attack them from the front or the back, this video shows how to protect themselves and take precedence over the attacker.
If the attacker is attacked by the attacker, then return must be made to clearly see the attacker and avoid shot spots.
The weapon must then be rounded between his predecessor and shoulder and shut down into the face of the opponent with his free eland.
Then there is a buzzle in the circle, and while the attacker boats up, he has to take his hand, take a face with a gun light and relinquish to continue to make a weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching the front, the situation is similar: avoiding shot trajectories, stopping the weapon and spreading it in such a way that the village cannot shoot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon, and there must be an end to the opponent's barber and finally remove his weapon and resign.
Hearful complexity?
Look at the video to see exactly what the Mamrake is doing.
But remember, if you are not the meistle of Krav Maga, it is safer to give the robber his money.
The family of the andouchs is demolishing the social home of Saltawa Cornvol. and is being put on the street.
The family of the wandchildren has been left out of the place of refuge to terrorise a neighbour by damaging the social home of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Sons Trebilkok were evicted from the property of the island of Cornwall, as a number of complaints were made of them.
When they were forcibly evicted from property, the appalled medical service representatives found that property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the ride behind the wall, the waste was hungry everywhere and the wall had been bred with graffiti.
The family is now evicted from property and is most likely living in a private ownership.
Donna Makevoj, the manager of the Cornwall Services, says there are concerns that housing cannot be restored.
She tells us that the people who lived there have been extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live in this way.
A number of factors need to be assessed in this case, since in future this property will not be good in Cornwall.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The other had three sons who have been physically owned and police say that their terror was marked by violence, the outward affair, bullying of the local population, drug use, drug trafficking and louding and salvation.
The 47 year-old Skellow, the name of which has been property, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour in June.
Amount waste was found in several demolished houses.
In the home where drugs have previously been traded, several flooring boards have also been discovered.
Neighbours say that they have been on the streets regularly and are constantly being called the police.
The Kornvolon Housing Service put them out of property under coercion when they had 11 weeks to collect the house on a voluntary basis.
The desperate neighbours were very happy about eviction because their lives had been zero.
One said, 'They are not concerned by other citizens'.
We lived there for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It is incredible how often we have seen the police here.
We could not sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so silent - we are not used to it!
Now that they are leaving, it will be wonderful.
Adams Fitzpatron, a Senior Manager for the Kornvolon Housing service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family has been living here for 20 years, and the police have been regularly named here.
A variety of old and unworkable objects were found in the garden of the home.
He also said, 'It is a great pity that the Irish did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because evicing the home is always the last step that the Kornvolon Housing Service has to confront.'
This was a very difficult case, because their behaviour was extreme and neighbours have had to look very hard at their behaviour.
I appreciate the work that all my team, Davinton and Cornwall police and compact members have played in this file, who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make the lives of the neighbours easier and show that antisocial behaviour is unacceptable.
He said that the three sons had lived there in different time periods, but that everyone was around 20 years old.
A dirty mattress running at the floor of one room after eating.
The service's employees will now have to meet the warehouse set aside in the house.
In 2014, the police carried out searches and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, scales, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
It is only found guilty of the storage of class B drugs for the purpose of distribution.
She said that the money was supposed to be a monument to her son, Lord Šelner, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After eviction, it has become apparent that they now rent a private property in a Plima.
Many of the home walls had their graph taken up.
The police tell us that they will continue to evade tenants who break their rent contracts.
This eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to infringe the rules, and the Kornan Police spokeswoman Maria Krova said this eviction is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, 'This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and have no consequences'.
The police in Davinón and Kronlinn do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Preparedness can give an impulse to the economy.

The Mayor of Cannes banned the burkha in beaches.
The Mayor of Cannes in the south of France has banned the valleaching of burky corners that almost entirely cover the woman's body and very much resemble hydrolysis, according to local officials on Thursday.
Cannes, David Linster, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone without bathing areas that respect good customs and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
A smokward wap that determines religion at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks can lead to a risk of disturbances of public order (clothes, clashes, etc.) that need to be eliminated, "the statement says.
"We are not talking about a ban on the wearing of religious symbols at the beaches, but about beautiful clothing, which entails confidence in the terrorist movements that war with us," local public service chief Tierra Miguel said in a statement.
He added that the letters had not been seen in the beaches of Cannes since August 28, when the Republican spokesman of the centre-right party, Linster, signed the order and entered into force.
This week, a park in Marseille lifted a planned private measure for Muslim women dressed in burkes in freshwater corners, as indignation was expressed by both right-wing and left-wing politicians.
In France it is forbidden to wear Six women's headscarves, but religious symbols or corresponding clothes are not banned.

On the island of Lucavuza, the festival "Cuba."
On Thursday, 11 August, one of the last festivals of this summer was opened in Lucavw, where there will be 'Cuba' until the night of Sunday.
At the first evening, groups such as Enter Shikari from Great Britain, who were awaited last year, had not lost their program, NOFX, Dr Maxim of the Produgy group and others.
In the next Festival Mass, the programme has noteworthy words: "Guano Apes" and Garbage, "Brutto & Lyny, Whoto Vidoplyasova, Ukrainians, and a number of others, but the full programme of the measure can be viewed here.
This is the second year in which the festival Kubana is taking place in Latvia.
Last year, it suffered a financial failure and huge losses, but it was not kept out of a repeat attempt - they added a taste to the name, and said that the festival has now become "closest to the local flash alongside the Riga symbols of its panoribility and cats."
Whether these efforts won it is premature to judge, because the festival has just floated but, as Delfi's entertain first observed last night, at least as long as a huge amount of people's efforts have failed and the number of visitors was similar to last year.
The British trebicycle team twice fills the Olympics record and wins on the queues.
The British treal team twice amended the Olympic flame on Thursday and won a rock race for men.

It should be noted that record has also been corrected in the qualification of women for catching purposes: the British team changed the record of the world, which is now 4: 13.260.
The President who remained in the building: Gustavam Zemgale, 145.
Friday 12 August marks the 14th anniversary of the birth of the second Latvian President, Gustav Zemgale.
The Zemgale proclaimed the Latvian state, but the famous first president of Latvia's former President Zakot and the former President of the pre-war, Kārlis Ulmouth, remained gratutely palpable.
No one of our statesmen has so much defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgale, Gustav Havel, a decade ago, writes Arnocide Admirage to Gustav Zemgale.
Delfi Annan is one of the few senior politicians in the world who has a sense of humour.
Others such sticks are always very correct.
This may not be the case today; nowadays, it might be similar to what Raimonds Vejonis is like.
"He was close to the people," Aymo said.
Today's politicians miss history, they referred to Kārlis Ulman as a good leader, but rarely knows how unfit he was.
The only person to whom he had not been quitched was General Baltiis at the government's sitting.
Even if he was kind and smile in the bills, he was hysterical after nature.
"The baby with his humour and democracy leaves exactly the opposite impression," Aymo said.
Professor Aivars Stranga, Faculty of History and philosophy at the University of Latvia, agrees with the Monfi Annan assessment of the Earth as a peaceful and weighed statesman.
He also notes that the Zemgale raised respect for minorities, regularly called on Jewish members to attend the presidential palace.
"At that time it was not normal, after the Zemgale presidency, Albert Kassis took over the tradition," the historian said.
He was a silent and weighed person who had long had to talk to become President.
He did not aspire like that, just did not pay the glory.
He was also quite critical because he did not know the French language, but considered that the President would certainly have to understand it.
"In the course of the Presidency, the fundamentals of the French language were learned," Stranga said in a statement.
The soldier did not relinquish to stand for candidature, he did not like it at all.
In all ways he has a very respected personality in the history of Latvia; he was in a serious position before becoming the president - he was a very demanding notary.
The Zemgali led the renowned Zemgale in the Suvorova street in 3, where a member of the repository and the colourants was present, and was practically speaking to the Latvian state in practice.
He was always progressive.
It was not a great businessman but he did not mind him in public.
"While in private negotiations, it has sometimes said that the functioning of Ulmaica does not help him," Stranga said in a statement.
There was a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of irregularities or corruption.
How does Earners remember today?
It is a pity, but for a great part he is associated with one street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, the views were the centrepiece.
"At his time, there was no major turbulence, and that is to say that he could connect with such a true stable presidency," Stranga said in a statement.
Gustav also took part in a visit by the Latvian State to Sweden during the Autumn 1927-1930, which indirectly meant simultaneous acknowledgement by Latvia of its full recognition in a neighbouring country and integration into the democratic nation of northern Europe.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgale arrived at a state visit to Stockholm.
The reply of the King of Sweden, Gustav v. Latvia, was held on 29 June 1929.
The second president of the Latvian state was born in 1871 and died in eternal January 1939.
It is simply a way of helping a child to cope with anger gulfs.
I often have to face the fact that the child's anger, the emergence of a niche, is seen by parents as wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows her anger - we do not know how to react, Econet says psychology JekattestKesa.
Specialist calls for a narrow round of talks on these so natural and human feelings - anger and anger that each one faces periodically.
Aggression - this is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, alarmed, we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can throw your anger and furniture: express, suppress, hide, keep on your side, tell your friends or other loved ones - go a dug, crack down the table and do other things that we do not usually do.
We do not attack our aggression, because we know different ways of dealing with these emotions.
Children seeking anger do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say 'away away', 'You're fool', 'I see you', 'I don't see you' - and very rarely to say 'I'm angry to you'.
Children live in literally, they are completely here, at this point, they are spontaneously and indeed showing their feelings, and often find themselves in various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid a child to show their feelings, including anger, not shaming about it and not, but, on the contrary, help the child.
Do you have to worry about the relationship?
A long working day, in which everything has not really gone as it would have liked, or simply bad, is so many reasons why I would like for a moment, a day, or even longer, to be able to switch off from anywhere in the world.
Can you also look at the relationship for a while and breathe a little?
Or, though, does this indicate that each of the partners has a way to go?
In their opinions, ladies and gentlemen are divided.
Jānis (23) is brief and succinct: 'In my view, if relations need to be accompanied, then you are not with the right person'.
Meanwhile Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that may be helpful to anyone.
If you feel that the partner starts to fall out on the nerve for every small detail, then surely it is the right moment to look at other hunting fields to see if you lack her or whether or not they want to see him or not at all.
So the answer is, yes, withholding a card can save time and see how important you have the other half a.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
I think it is necessary to get one from one another during your relations, because if you spend time with a man 24 hours a day, seven days a week, disputes are inevitable.
The reason for this is that I take every detail that the other does, and it is starting to fall on the nerves.
People are beginning to tide to each other, especially when it is not even anything to talk about, just about what you have done on a daily basis.
My own personal experience suggests this, so I have not passed the relationship for more than a couple of months either.
If you think for a while that things are better elsewhere or anywhere, why is this woman with whom you are standing together deserve one who can think that it is not good enough and there is a paradise of behaviour behind the mountains?
Depreciation is already a small treason.
If they do not, they do not.
"I have, so I would like to punish those who are not," said Edmunds (46).
The slogan (33) is just the opposite opinion.
It seems to me that everyone needs a time for a break.
You could not watch each other for a moment, all the time, from morning to night and laughed at the blow love.
Give in.
There are so many things - friends, work, ballages.
Everyone has its time.
Of course, friendship or wives too, but if both are able to balance their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the brink of the grave.
That is the way it works.
Mārtiņš (27) said: "It's hard to say, you need, you don't need, you can't take it, but one thing is certain - it is not something that is lacking in the relationship to the end."
If this matter is raised then it will be assumed that there will be some change in the near future - for the good or bad side, it depends on ourselves.
I think while you are new and crazy, you need some time, but when things remain serious and relations go down to another phase, then there can be no question of rest.
You decide to spend the whole life together!
"If you cannot withstand each other's society and take some breathing time at the moment, then what will it be when you'll be pensioners who comment on how passing the gardens ought to be better known," Kristaps (19) said.
All the gentlemen's words have been changed.
With his enthusiastic and enthusiastic personality, Rozental first awakened an interest in the lats' people for fathers's arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvians, as it will remain forever," he wrote Romans Dota for the Latvian artist Jani Rozenburg.
In 2016, when detecting the grand retrospective exhibition in the main building of the Latvian National Art Museum, it is clear that Rozental is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but has been available for visitors from 13 August and will be open until 30 October.
The Latvian National Art Museum honours the glezionist Jani Rozental (1866-1916), whose centen-fiftieth birthday at international level is part of UNESCO's celebration calendar.
The retrospective exhibition, which covers more than 150 work, is one of the central events of the annual programme of the Yeter Rozeneman anniversary.
The selection of arts is largely driven by the Latvian National Art Museum, which strongly representative the main stages and gents of the CFR, the diversity of styal variability and techniques.
Examples from the Schmallena-Kallela museum, the Museum of Rakversies, Museum, Liepaja Museum, the Museum of Tuke and several private collections in Latvia and Finland have been used.
Imagine presence, mobile aping of exhibitions reveals the mixing of certain art works with photographs that the painting driver has admitted to his own photograph for creativity.
The Latvian National Art Museum also offers a small exhibition on the Latvian National Art Museum, "with a surprise in Latvia, with a heart in Latvia."
A similar exhibition with content in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the autumn to the 'Virka' gallery in Helsinki.
Mets Leblanc looks forward to return to Topher in the show.
Mets Leblanks, head of the Television broadcasts, said that he looked forward to returning to the second season of the car shock, but said he did not know what he expected in the future.
Nothing officially happens yet.
"If there is, the BBC will announce it," Leblank said in a conversation with TV critics.

Kolegova is refusing to stand as leader of the Revenue Service.
The Head of the National Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, has decided to withdraw his candidature for the post of Director-General of the National Revenue Service (Revenue Service), LETA was informed by the Finance Ministry.
Collegova said that the discussion on her candidature had multiplied tensions among the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real causes of the discussions are linked to the political vision, but more often the blind one, and have nothing to do with assessing my professional abilities.
"I do not accept that either," he said.
If her candidacy were confirmed in government, it was clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would prevent him from fully working and realising the necessary changes in the Revenue Service, with all the support of the government.
"Without it there will be no full-time work," said Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly said publicly that I do not want to be politically dependent, but now all my candidature is overly politicised," he said.
"Thank you for the confidence and support I have shown, it is a experience I value as a benefit," Kolegova said in a statement to Reizniece-Ozola.
The agreement on Wednesday considered that the meeting with Kolegow revealed a "significant contradiction" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the cost of dividends as publicly available in the public register.

The Riga holiday has introduced all the recommendations of the NC for the Russian island project.
The Riga Free Port has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (NC) on the development of the Russian island project for the transfer of port activities from the city centre, portal Died.lv had informed the company.
The approval of the project will take place in the near meeting of the Riga Airport Board.
In order for recommendations to be implemented in line with the recommendations of the VC in preparing the documentation required for implementation, the Riga Free Authority was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte Riga, and the recommendations made to improve the management of the project at the later stage of the project.
The VC has also been sent a report on the implementation of the recommendations today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Port does not agree with the opinion of the VC on the usefulness of implementing the Russian island project, we are very responsible to the implementation of the project and to the financing provider, the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the construction works planned within the project have been fully completed within the agreed deadlines and to the extent planned.
"In order to demonstrate to all those involved in the project, including the EC, the NRC and also the stividers, that the main purpose of the holiday is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the NC recommendations on project management and monitoring issues," said Sanita Kaire, head of the Russian Project.
The long-term operational plan for the monitoring and monitoring of the achievement of the project has been complemented by the main planned actions of the parties concerned and the timing of the necessary decisions, the definition of meetings and regular reporting, the monitoring tools for the planned building process as well as the definition of key points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project by 31 December 2018 will be complemented by performance monitoring actions, in line with the VC recommendations, thus reinforcing the control of the deadlines for other parties involved in project implementation by the Riga Free Port.
The project management plan defining the management areas of the project and identifying the documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them have been redrafted in order to improve project management and reduce potential risks.
Project management structures have been developed to enhance project capacity, reflecting the planned design of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of staff.
A draft Stakeholder Communication Plan has been drawn up to improve the management communication of the Riga Free Port with the parties involved, which, in addition to the Parties in the Project Action Plan, defines stakeholders interested in the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of the exchange of information.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of funds, further justification should be given to the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the opening of procurement, and the rule of law.
As part of the project, the Russian island has constructed a port infrastructure that complies with global standards, four new deep-water reservoirs, rail pipelines and civil engineering.
Contributions co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into service at the end of the year, with an expected savings of €10.6 million.
Threats have resulted in increased security in Slovakia at airports.

German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of fatalities at the Communist border of the former East German border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the actual number of victims remain undispelled.
According to the data released on Wednesday by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, 1,841 people have been murdered between 1945 and 1989, trying to get out of their controlled territory.
Museum has been investigating the number of deaths on a border for years and corrects the number of victims every moment.
A further 11 deaths were added to the list this year, including a six-year-old boy drowned when he tried to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall, there are also Soviet army deters.
"The physical damage caused by the double evil of Communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," said Alexander Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape from the Communist state controlled by the Communist state would be repaired and not disappeared," he said.
But other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is untenable," Johen Schwart told the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.
He, along with other researchers from the Berlin Free University, is currently reviewing potential suspicious deaths at the border, and has so far succeeded in approving only 260 cases.
Previously, there were 138 people murdered by the Communists at the Berlin Wall.
In view of those people who have died trying to flee the Baltic Sea or to land through the territory of neighbouring countries, the number of victims could, in my view, be around a thousand.
However, this is still considerably less than 1841.
One reason for the difference in the number of victims could be the different methodologies.
Charlie Mmuseum also lists all suicides of the East German border guards, whether directly related to their service.
Museum also lists deaths which are not accompanied by direct violence.
"If the elderly aged between 70 and 80 died from a heart attack after breaking with border control, it must be the consequence of this' murdepression '.
However, Schwart is convinced that there must be a distinction between the old people who may have died as a result of their experience and those who have been caused by prolonged waiting at the border at the time of the hot.
Regardless of this, the inventory is not easy, as the Communist East Germany authorities did not stockpile such statistics, and the researchers must pass the documents in the different archives, said Schwart.
However, the Group of Schwear has recently compiled new documents and could therefore present a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
The President of the LPF, Pone on the Rio, saved with the accreditation of the coacher; it is surprising for itself.
Kaspars Pone, the Latvian President of the Federation of Pushers (LPF) in the last few days, has apparently been accredited in Rio de Janeiro, but felt impressed by it.
A great deal of amazement follows on from the statements by Germans Jakubovska, the Olympic awardman, who said that at the last minute he decided to leave Pone while the coach remained at home.
Joaquin Ribakova and Uvis Kalnins, the coachers Jakubovsky and Deivus Collins, as well as the President of the Federation, Pone, were initially on the list.
Prior to the Olympic Games, the Latvian authorities asked five participants for the Olympic Games, and before his departure Aldon Vrublevskis said Germans was going to have his tickets.
"However, he did not, for objective reasons," said Pone, adding that he had no influence on the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, Uvja coach assumed to assist her.
Pone, who himself is a member of the executive committee of the LOK, has strongly criticised the activities of the SLOK, which led to the organisation of the organisation that supervises the Olympic Games.
In my view it is unethical to approve five individuals in the SLOK executive committee and one which should not be taken from them.
"I do n't know why the Bathing Federation did not have any place," Pone said, referring to the lack of recognition of the work of the Federation and their presidents, recalling that the Federal President did not receive any pay.
He also criticised Mr Jakubovsky himself in saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not confirmed by the member, he appealed to the International WWD (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
One could not tell me why he is in the Olympic Games with the accreditation of a coacher, which was probably due to Jakubovsky.
"I was appointed as a leader of the Federation, but I got the training of the coach for for some reason and now I'm not doing anything in the home."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditation available changed.
Until the last minute I thought Germans would be, because there was no other information.
According to LETA, a couple of days before Ribakov, she had a conversation to her eye with Pons, but the president of the LPF himself said that it had been a daily conversation with the desire to throw the athletes before the start.
Pone recalled that the FPF oversees five sports activities in the Olympic scheme, four of which are also underway for children in Latvia.
The president of the Federation said drowning issues were also very important in Latvia, and he also talked about programmes in Rio de Janeiro for almost two weeks.
He praised the federation's work and said he could take the World Cup stage in 2018.
The trauma at Rio is not my leave, I worked, spent my time and tried to implement the four-year programme.
600,000 salmon juveniles will be released in Daugava.
The plans to rebuild fish stocks in Daugava this week led to the arrival of more than 600,000 pet salmon and pipe babies from the fisheries factories of the scientific institute Bior Tomé and Doles.
LETA was informed by the Treasury Department that the release of fish is continuing for the next few months - 6 300 000 juvenile and boat boats in the Daugava basin each year.
In spring and summer 2016, the shores of the leaders and the Egyptians will be lifted, the salmon in June, the summer salmon in July, August and September for zantar and vimble.
Latvia's manufacturing director Māris Kukicken said that care about the environment was one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Tenergo group.
"For the protection and reproduction of fish resources, everyone is focusing on environmentally-friendly actions, in close collaboration with the scientific institute, Bior, carrying out both the rearing and entry into Daugava basin of juveniles and the realisation of other activities," Kicken said.
This year more than 600 000 juvenile and present baby juveniles will be placed on the sidelines of Daugava.
For a second year, babies have been tagging on their fats before they are put on the market.
Today, there are 25 000 juveniles in the crack with average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, juvenile and boat boats are subjected to scientific and quantified species in the water bodies of Daugava and in the water bodies of the basin.
The reproduction of fish resources in Daugava and its basin in water bodies is delegated by the Commission, under the law, on the basis of the expertise of loss caused by economic activities carried out in Latvia and by providing a conclusion on what compensation measures are necessary to ensure the diversity of fishery resources.
The National Environmental Service, on the basis of that expertise, decides on the scope and nature of the compensation.
Latvia's annual compensation amount for the recovery programme is €1 035 000.
In spring 2016, Latvia deployed 400 artificial fish spawning nest nest nest in Daugava on Shibalas and Qatar in spring 2016.
Cooperation with the member in promoting the natural vodage of fish is supported by the initiative supported by Latvia as part of the programme for the recovery of fish resources.
The stationing of artificially spawning nests in water is an important measure contributing to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.

It is true that if Clinton will be elected President, she will appoint Garlande to a judge at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Democratic Party of the Senate, Harry Rehid, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will nominate Merlan Garlande as chief judge of the Supreme Court.
The Republican Party of the Senate has blocked the approval of Garlanda since March, when he was nominated by President Obama.
He said that the next president would choose who would replace the current judge of the Supreme Court, Mr Antonis Scaliu.
On Thursday, during his conference, Rehid said she was confident that Clinton would choose Timlande.
The representative of the Reida later said that he had personally failed to talk about the matter with Clinton, and that is just speculation.
He praised Garlande and said that the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" with another choice.
Hollande is the chief judge at the US Department of Apellation in Colombia.
The state said that the seculs blocking the nomination of Garlande are "destinies" and act in the interests of Donald Trump, candidate for the Republican presidential candidate.
He also said that Trump was not fit for the president's work.

The French court rejects the request to dismantle stores in the 'Jungle' refugee camp.
The French court dismissed the Kalin authorities for the destruction of dozens of self-established stores and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where there were thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing in Calais this week, the authorities said that the country should mix 72 self-established stores where people sell different goods such as cigarettes and energy beverages, offer hairdressing services, tea by 50 cents (40pp) and simple meals for some of the euro in self-constituted restaurants.
In Calais the prefect bureau pointed out that these self-inflicted companies had to be dismantled as they create a black economy and pay taxes, as well as cause fires and sanitary risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group have explained to the court that these small enterprises are essential because the food provided by governments and support groups does not guarantee the needs of the camp, where the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-inflicted shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those most in need.
The Lille court ruled that there is no legal basis for expelling people who have created 72 stores, but understands the concerns of the prefect in Calais.
Jans-Francoa Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely precarious conditions."
He said these seats were peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places exposed to demolition is the Jungle Book Capital end of the camp, which provides more than 200 free meals, English and French, and provides advice on asylum issues for hundreds of unaccompanied minors without adult paths.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of a child cafe.
The letter addressed to the Guardian points out that the winding-up of a cafe would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old. "
On Friday, the two charities' Help for Refugees' and 'L'Auberge des Migrants' said that the number of residents of the Jungle camp has risen to 9000, the highest rate since the rapid surge of migrants in the summer.
Britain gets the silver regasi-7 serial battle when the Fiji Islands is hungry blowing the gold.
Britain's impressive performance at the rega-7 serial phase ended on Thursday, when the Rio Fiji Islands seized safely with effect 43: 7 at the Deodoro stadium.
Fiji has demonstrated a lies in bomb management, bombs play a foot, support the game and brutally play a game by fighting gold, the first Olympic medals in its history.
The consery brought up a respectable consolation prize - the silver medal that was the third medal of Britain on the day: British politics can be proud of its success in the first Olympic rub-7 turny where they conducted New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Serious fight in the halftist in which the Bok team defeated at the end of 7: 5 days in the first half of the day may be refuted in the United Kingdom.
But in any case Fiji's sample is currently in its best shape to win the 15th team.
Although unlikely, there might be a certain calm for Britain: at least one brother won gold medal, a former manager of Fiji's Wimblebon coach.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, in the management of Raw, they lost all games at the region-7 series in Adevel.
This time they lost only one game.
Production is painful, but growth is surprising.
Fiji was impressively beginning the match, reshielding British use of strength for fun.
The LTTE's daughter for the first time in the second half of the year saw Osea Kolinisau win the first season.
In the last four minutes, Jerijs Tuwai further increased the predominance to the right wing.
The 12: 0 result and the British team were not even really touched by the ball.
The excellent method of moderation in Mičas did not allow Leone Nakarabrahim to get three points, but it only had a little impact on Fiji's outcome.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremua gained ground in the right corner, strengthening the prevailing over Britain to 17: 0.
After the match, Nakarava had even further increased the balance and remained over a minute until the end of the first half of the year.
Mr Ravouvou avoided some clumsy methods of British strength and crossed the line with points.
The margin provided a result 29: 0.
Fiji seems to be born to play rug-7 games, while the British have yet to learn.
In fact, that is also true.
The British team made profound changes half-time by breaking off Fiji's line... the full four minutes after the first half-time standards until Joshua Tuisov took over a few further points in favour of Fiji's team after fantastic team games.
Denis Nortonyi has succeeded in getting points on the left corner with a result of 36: 7, but the game had already been lost, while the fans of Southern maritime flats were singing, waved flags and deckes.
Fiji's behaviour cannot be admired.
Mata Viliame made Fiji's victory even more sweeter, with another landing at the end of the game.
Fiji was able to celebrate at the end of the game, while the British allowed to sit on the theatre after defeat.
In the first half of the day, Fiji had a ranking of 20: 5, while the British were over to South Africa, where the two teams had a very tough fight and the South was only a few.
In the first half, Kails was nominated by Book, while Dens Nortons crossed the line with brilliant lies and brought the ball between the columns by providing the British with a victory.
The great strength of the force in the end of the game, Markill Vatanen, who is Sandou-15, served as a team victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
Trenger's fight against cancer inspired Helena Glover and Heteri Stanley's victory in the rowing competition.
It will be the most emotional cogold medal in these races, and that is already a great deal.
From the first to the last cancer, the gold of Helena Glover and Hetee Stanley played a special role in the ship of Estacio de Lagoa.
Though there are only two athletes in boat, they were accompanied by the voice of Robert Viljamin, who inspired up to the second Olympic gold medals in the rowing of women, becoming the first women in the history of British sport which has made such progress.
They were unquestionably dominated because, for the 39 time, they won an unbearable, unprecedented victory.
The two excellent athletes drove the water surface with a bed elegant and do not fully reflect this triumph.
There is a whole team behind the rowing of each gold of gold that worked hard to keep athletes continuously improving their performance, and the major contribution to their success has been given by the coach, who never knew for 30 months ago that he had a cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had a cancer of uralin, which is one of those that can and should be operated.
If not, it would spread to the whole body.
And things would get out of hand.
It slightly modifies your vision.
Counterfest cancer was opened in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to have started the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 intermediate season and reduced the duration of the interruption to a minimum, if so.
I had a need for income so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in hospital and I walked 6, 10 and even 15 metres long, even though the doctor said that a few steps would suffice.
All this began.
Airline is a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Vilmaan, who was very excited about the morning and speaking more than usual during the disturbance.
Standing, which has been in the Royal Artillery unit in Afghanistan, said, 'This was a week of emotionally heavy week, but it means a great deal for me'.
It merely confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helena and Robin have worked for.
The 3 years of the past 3 years have been excellent.
Without Robin, we would not have achieved anything, so thank him very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I cannot imagine a better coache or a better coache.
In five years, Helena Glover and Hetere Staninga have lost some races.
A couple is reaching such a huge speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanley and Glover were overweight.
We felt every minute.
Helena was shouting: "Keeping the rhythm is keeping the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We managed to launch a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day we had no intention to overthrow the record, but simply to aire and win the race, and that is what we have done.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedder of Glover and TV adventure, Steve Bashala.
She simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I did not want to say that this was my last competition.
That would have been too much pressure.
In London I needed about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion.
It has been a new experience and I was very frustrated.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, 'Sajois fantastic'.

To mark the 90th anniversary of the National Library of Los Angeles, something else, as a new book!
Purchasing to the head of the Revenue Service will take place until the last. "
Prime Minister Māris Kucink and Finance Minister Danai Reizniece-Ozola (Union of Greens and Farmers) are now "principally important" to endorse former finance minister Aplegova as head of the Revenue Service.
Lewandowski estimated that both Kuchink and Reizniece-Ozbollah in the government had the approval of the Revenue Service's head as "the first big decision" that could affect their future as politicians.
If the position of the Revenue Service's candidate for the Revenue Service is now to be changed, it will have a negative impact on their freedom in the public administration.
The agenda of the next week of the Ministerial Cabinet includes the question of the transfer of OVD-leader Kolegova to the Revenue Service Director General, according to the government's agenda.
Finance minister Reizniece-Ozola was steered by Kolegova following the resignation of Inary Petersone from the Service's management and when a competition to the Revenue Service's Director-General ended without result.
Dace Peleka, leader of the Revenue Service, told Latvian Radio on Thursday 11 August that if she had been offered to run for a driving seat, she could agree.
The Finance Minister later admitted that the candidates for the Revenue Service of the Revenue Service were not being considered for the time being.
Raivis Dzintars, head of the Saeima building of the National Union, also said that the NA continues to support Kolegova under the Revenue Service.
In Spain, the capacity to reduce the deficit is jeopardised by the failure to establish a government.
A month ago, on 12 July, the European Commission (EC) issued an opinion that Spain and Portugal failed to implement sufficient measures to reduce the level of their government deficit to the 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) required by the Euro Zone.
According to estimates, Portugal's budget deficit was 4. 4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5. 1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while imposing fiscal targets for the coming period.
One reason why the EC has not implemented sanctions against the two countries has been one of the growing euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Further sanctions would only increase this negative mood.
According to critics, the EC's decisions are inconsistent in agreeing on common rules from the start and then failing to apply them in practice.
For example the President of the German Bundesbank, Jenos Veidmant, has pointed out that Europe is losing credibility in this way, giving citizens the impression that European Union rules are recommendations and not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved an extension of the deadline for correcting the deficit by the end of this year for Portugal and by 2018 for Spain.
The European Commission promises to check the progress of both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial forecasts indicate that Portugal's target could be met in due course and the budget deficit could already fall to 2. 5% of GDP by this year.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of that country must implement austerity measures of 0. 25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention being paid to the control of the costs of purchasing goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year, the deficit has to be reduced to 4. 6%, to 3. 1% next year and to 2. 2% of GDP in 2018.
In addition, consolidation measures should be 0. 5% of GDP annually over the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have been unable to agree on the formation of a government for eight months now makes it increasingly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
However, opinion polls suggest that the third elections in the country of political scenes would not change substantially.
The Popular Party is still a popular party led by the current Prime Minister, Mariano Rhoja, whose election would once again produce less than 33% of the votes.
Only Socialists have increased their popularity, while the popularity of Podemos, or 'Together we can' and Ciudadanos, or 'Citizens', has fallen slightly.
The People's Party wants to get the Socialists and Ciudadanos back into government later this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission the draft 2017 budget for approval by mid-October.
As stated by the representative of the People's Party's Parliamentary Party, Rafael Hernando, if the government fails and parliamentary elections are held for the third time, Spain will become a ridicule for the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of smooks in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
Five years later, by surveying the beaches, the activists have concluded that, unfortunately, the number of discovered waste is rising every year, and the majority of bathing sites blame for this.
The most polluted sites are in Riga.
The city council says that bathing sites are copied every day, but that the fight against dirty visitors is very difficult.
In addition, land abandonment can be washed into water during heavy rainfall, thereby seriously damaging its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beach and certain sites in Kurzeme, the plight of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This is an announcement this week by the volunteers of the campaign 'My Sea' campaign.
Five years on the road along the Gulf of Riga, the activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every 100 metres.
Unfortunately, this year it has become a critical assessment.
"We can see that this will be a year in which the number of waste per beaches per 100 metres is likely to exceed 200 units," said Janis Ulme, member of the expedition "my sea."
The Latvian Radio channel was ranked in the beach at the beach where a volunteer march along the Gulf of Riga continues.
This year, even fluorescent lamps left in the sand of the sea have had to be collected between different municipal waste and pyrosical stays.
The convoy member and organiser Ulmantec said that it was the people who were responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beaches themselves, because more than half of the total waste consists of plastic, various waste ranging from bags, plastic pieces already in degradation, it is no longer possible for them to be identified, and for smoke, bottles, corks," Ulme said.
There are also bathing sites between the dirst beaches in Riga.
In Daugavpils, for example, almost 800 waste units have been collected every hundred metres, which is a critical mass.
The organisers of the campaign also make it clear that there are also smokers and signs of warning or prohibition on a daily basis.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing sites - Daugavpils, Vacarrobul and Elda - are unfortunately coming large and far beyond the desired or target, which Latvia is progressing by reducing the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020," the environmental defender said.
Thuris Vidauskis, a spokesman for the winning site, is running every day at the summer's hotter days.
However, the fight against dirty visitors is rather difficult.
We return to the cultural issue of these people.
"People who mention alcohol use alcohol, smoke and do all things that cannot, even special signs, do not work," Kucinskis said.
The latter therefore calls on bathing sites to report polluters to the police as well.
You can call a police, indicate these violations securely and then fight for everyone.
Some new warnings may be made, but as I have said, this will hardly change the situation drastically.
"As everyone together simply has to turn up and be intolerant of such offenders," he says.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time this summer by a Health inspectorate which may impose a ban on official bathing areas.
This year, as in other years, water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
Today, the situation is that, in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has been good all the time and there are no restrictions on bathing.
"It is the last time we will analyse the analyses at the end of August," said Normunds Kadiķis, senior professional in environmental affairs.
In the case of heavy rainfall, terrestrial waste may be washed into the water.
This may in turn affect its quality, according to an environmental professional.
Rotation in the Russian elite continues - change of leader in Putin's administration.
Who was left behind?
Vladimir Putin has announced to the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov will leave the office himself and will continue to be a Special Representative of the President for the Protection of Nature, Ecology and Transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin has been paying tribute to Ivanovad in front of his television cameras: 'Dear Sergej Borisov, we have been working together with you for many years and we are doing so successfully'.
I am pleased with the way in which you fulfil the duties you have been given to you.
I remember well of our agreement not to use you in this capacity as head of the presidential administration for more than four years.
I therefore understand your desire to change the scope of the action with awareness.
And I hope you will fully use your knowledge and experience in your new role.
It is noted, however, that the management of the President's administration is a very important position and made Ivanov the most influential in the country.
In view of the forthcoming elections to the Duma elections in Russia next month, it was rumoured that this step was linked to the power struggle over power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov has also been called the potential candidate for President Putin, so the statement that he himself wanted to take up the post of President of the President in the area of nature protection and transport has raised doubts.
Ivanov is the KGB and the Secretariat-General of the Federal Security Service, according to Liter.lv archive.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his DRL in 1975 when he was familiar with Putin.
He became Deputy Governor of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed a Secretary of Security Council of the Russian Federation.
In 2000, after Putin had been in power, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Mrs Ivanova, which included the revival of state censorship mechanisms in Russia, was confirmed.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became Minister of Defence of Russia, but already in 2005 as Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Hradkova, who was responsible for the development of Russian defence industries and arms exports.
Now, after leaving the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain his seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Mr Waino, will also be present.
The cull comes from a family in the elite of the Soviet Party.
The head of the presidential administration Waino was appointed by Ivanov himself.
We have long been familiar with Mr Eduardoviz.
One of the time when we worked in government under your chairmanship.
And for almost five years we have been in touch on practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that, after all the professional and personal qualities, he is ready for the job," Ivanov said.
The woman comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet elite.
His grandfather Karls has held high positions in the Communist Party of Estonia, including a ten-year mandate until 1988 as its first secretary.
The internet edition with a reference to the book "Estonia's self-determination and independence" writes that, at the end of the 80s, Karls Vaino had asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators.
However, he had received the opt-out and had lost his office in the near future.
Shortly after that, Waino has moved to Moscow.
Antonis Vaino has graduated Moscow's Institute of International Relations and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's protocol.
It has already been reported that the last miliest Russia has been shaken by the suspension of several high-ranking officials and even by arrests, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several areas.
President Vladimir Putin takes over the ruling elite before the elections in 2018, according to polytellogists.
One of the main features is the increasing frequency of representatives of force bodies at leading positions.
The Janjatian Tighter in Niziforenko is also losing the Olympic Games in the first fight.
This was the first step in the fight, and the Latvian Judo Clinton came to terms with his participation in the Olympic Games by refining at the scene.
Trenger Oleg Baskins told Latvian Television that there had been very little hope in Newcastrenica, which had already been clear ahead of the contest.
He also found that the junta blatted his shoulder.
Significantly, in order to be on the Olympic road map, Niziforenko has had to enter another weight category than it had previously been, namely for the weight category per 100 kilos.
The Armenian rip was 25 kilos more severe.
Jevgenijs Borodavko spent two and a half minutes in the game for Borodavko for two and a half minutes until the opponent had a clean victory.
As a result, Latvia has concluded the Awao race.
The rods disappear on the Rio sand.
The fourth was echoed by JUdman Jevgenijs Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but the ambitious can sometimes come as no surprise.
He did not worry.
In the case of Ayman Niziforenka, the task was even more complicated, as experience decreases and opponents were also respected.
The result was similar, although he held for one and a half minutes longer than the Borodavko.
Unfortunately, it is precisely the ambition of the Latvian JUDs that have been most lacking in recent times.
Gunars Jacinkevich stood out of the Latvian club at the Golden Score and the Golden Score is no longer in a downward curve.
Jacinkevich, who is advising the Kazakh Japanese, and Wenvolt Zelony do not see the heirs.
But if you don't raise it, there will be no one.
And that is the prerogative of a federation.
So, from another galaxy in the Rhite panorama, there was a promise from the President of the Latvian State Dudo to fight the medals.
The flight is far from reality.
Last night, Samoilovs / Šédder, Evanger / Peat Solbergs, waited with eagerness and concern.
The windfall of the 'death' group - the losers finished the game.
The Latvian duard had a small step - it could have been lost, but no more than four points in two seeds.
The prevalent last game was still growing.
No one wanted to die - the feeling above the canned corn was over the whole mess.
The winds that broke out in the game caused further complications.
At first, it seemed to be an ally of ours, which is more comprehensive.
But it did not happen.
It was enough to play the Latvian dug here.
Give it to Samoilovs and wait for him to come.
There was a burst in Canada, against Cuba at the end of the first season and at the start of the third, because the load was not a joke.
The motto could at that time allowed angling, because there was little work, but when it was, he did it honestly.
Samoilovs could have won two seasons with Smons because the first took over the lead with 16: 15, while 16 also remained on the threshold of lost points.
But it could also be lost with 0: 2, as the second half of the deficit was -4, but thanks to the wind, it was possible to win.
The third was already in the vanguard of Evanda.
The hide was up - the second match is often too close to the grid and Samoilovam left very few options for a fruitful attack.
If Samoilovs was against the Cubans this time, he worked better, and it would be unprofessional to draw the damage only to my own.
The Kremlin was wrong, and it is symbolic that he was hit by the last bomb in the bloc.
A team spreads.
There was certainly a lack of success this time - in the third season, two Evanders attacks almost fly out of the cort, but the ball was hit by the ball.
Two provinces were beside the line.
The controversial episode was also judged to favour opponents.
If, in the first two games, Evanger wrote with the Serbs, they were very productive to ours.
Everything together was summed up on the tabol.
Now the causes of the failure need to be analysed calmly.
Perhaps it should have been like many in the stadiums rather than with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It was two and a half hours ago.
Perhaps a little bit of confidence came from a seven-seallous series.
Perhaps it was nice to play but to come here faster and get better to write.
Perhaps there was a failure to find the upside of the athletic form.
So far, there is more than answers.
Our bishers were over.
The wave of medals is over.
What happens next?
Some of the World Cup Turks and the Jurmala Masters remain.
The modict with Samoilovs has never been friends and there will not be so because there are too many different personalities.
That is not what is needed, either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, there can also be a thought of divorce, because guilt will not only be sought in the face, but also in the partner.
It is not difficult, but it will be much harder to find a dignified partner in Latvia.
The two brothers play the ball, but Janis has tried and also selkled, while Mikhail Samoilovs is still too green to start off the top of the world.
Harare Regimes, Alexander Solove, Edgar Toys can try to return to Miss Gong, but it will not be better than this option, which was not recognised in the World Cup at all stages of the World Cup.
They did not smile at them this time.
That's all.
Of course, it must also be taken into account that beaches are becoming more popular, new couples are in circulation, and only the rare growth is less than two metres.
This is not yet a guarantee of success, but is an important argument in the fight for victory.
Modern longer is not the case.
Both sportsmen and journalists have the opportunity to wear and choose the Games.
The US basketball team lives on a cruise ship, while a proportion of tennis remain in the Olympic village.
In the same way, part of the beaches voyard has been searching for a hotel in the Codean.
This time, the rather modest night of the journalists who have been offered for journalists has been pushed through heavy overinflated prices.
So the choice fell to the Irish hardware Irish.
The risk is because sometimes they may be inconvenient from a logistical point of view.
At this time, the risk is justifying.
Together with Vladimir Vladimir, apparatus are on the border between the Codes and the Ipanera.
It lared 200 metres away from the bag in the march for half an hour.
Rajon is safe because favelas has a patrony, but there is no room for complacency.
Vladimir Putin is not what some people can imagine at all, while Vladimir Ivanov, a professional journalist in Russian affairs, is the most professional journalist in the Russian media.
P.S. looks like a dream of a further dream on Friday morning.
The 100 metre barrier and heater Laura Ibrauniece-Admidst lasted from their personal record.
There are already five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, Porgon and Besa skin Liepaja.
In Latvia, Porgrene and Besa were pre-studied in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognised susband has not yet been upheld.
This is why the organisers of the Cast Arts festival and the Liepaja art Forum decided, in close cooperation, to give the listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Guernsey.
"It is a great pleasure for us that, after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last installed by Liepaja, this excellent driver of the new, newly-identified" Lielais proar, "says Baiba Bože, head of the concert chamber.
The Porgin and Besa Opera are a vibrant musical story of love, lack of volatility, passions, and domestic tragedies and easy daily jobes.
American vitality, music and rhythm are reflected.
It is this lack of political correctness in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance, that makes it so animated.
"And yes, this love is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and really deep in some way," director Sairo said in a statement.
What I like most is that, listening to or bringing this opera, there are always the one-stops - the famous lies, the famous motives, but these transitions from one to the other, putting the spotlight on one individual or another, or the cori or the orchestra.
"This is the most exciting building," the opera named Porgen and Besa concert professor and conductor Andris Poga.
The operator is in agreement that this is a spectacular event.
It is a great pleasure for them to hear this beautiful Gmbassin operation in the world.
It is a shame that Liepaja can feel the world's breath.
"A professional," said Edgars Liga.
The concert was marked by the fact that, for the first time, a orchestra played a orchestra in the newly-found concert hall, and an operative concert behaviour was first held.
Farming under the Art Museum could name the refurbished building on behalf of Jay Rozental.
Riga Vice Mayor Andris Ameriks said at the opening of Rozenemaw that his own address could not be the future of the Museum in the future, but Jay Rozental's Square 1.
Miss Barto, Director of Museum, said that re-registration of the address would be a long bureaucratic burden, but overall this idea was welcomed and therefore accepted by the local government.
The city of Riga has laid down its kind of foundation in 1936 by setting up Burkarda Dzeň monument to Janim Rozensen, who is standing in the museum.
He was one of the initiators of this monument by the then Director of Museum.
This way, this move could be purely logical.
Personally, I am a little bit destructed at all times - but it is the Purchman Purchman, where we put his name? '
"But if you promise to think, Mr Ameriks,..."
It is reported that the National Art Museum building, after far-reaching reconstruction and modernisation, formally opened its doors in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Castle will be launched.
A full of around €11 million will be renewed for the SIA Velve.
Several palace rooms, including two screenings, are planned to be renovated, as well as the adaptation of the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga City Council intends to mobilise EUR 6 million of European Union funds for the project, while Oleg Burovs, Director of the Riga City Council, recognises that there is not yet total clarity on the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political will to launch VEF Culture Pililij in mobilising the European Structural Funds, we are waiting for months for a decision, for real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, for the money to be allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Finance Ministry received a letter from the European Commission that it would take the decision itself that Brussels does not take a decision.
Now we see another circle of discussion taking shape, so we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I want to say that the Riga City Council, without any doubt, guarantees that the process will be launched and completed within the deadlines," Mr Busrov said in a statement.
As reported, more than a year ago, in March 2015, the Castle of Culture of the VEF sponsored a blanket concert before immediately after the refurbishment of the building.
Although one year later, renovation of the building has still not started and has started to work collectively in unsuitable conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga City Council, the renovation of the VEF Culture Palace is split into supposedly independent reworks, where each will provide different crop rotation functions.
Firstly, increasing the availability of VEF Culture Castes and building the surrounding area.
It provides for sorting and engineering to be sorted out, as well as for the restoration of the brands of the building.
Second: Improving the supply of VEF cultural palace services.
It plans to improve the performance of the building's intersection, walls and turns, stage and sound recording, as well as arrange the internal engineers of the building.
Third: the improvement of the collective working conditions of reative amateurs, which include plans to improve workshop equipment, room heating and ventilation systems.
The legendary rock of the 40th anniversary of the Lives may be displayed at an exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will look at various "Laughic" subjects - photos summoned in the line to reflect the group's performance from beginning to 2010, when the end of the group is announced.
It will also show the actors' theses, musical instruments, awards and concerts, as well as other unseen cases of the wider public, which reflected the creative work of the group Laugi.
The exhibition will be supplemented by the articles of the Liepaja Museum stock.
The visual appearance of the exhibition is in collaboration with fashion artist and painting woman, Elda Patent.
The musicians, who had links to the Laugi group and their relatives, also responded to the call and divided themselves with subjects and memory.
The source of the "Lives" is to be found in 1972, when a vocal blueprint, led by Juris Pavtols, is being created in the House of Liepaja Culture.
The first part of the film festival was Liepaja's propulsion in 1972 and 1974, as well as the town and the Republics.
In 1979, a fatal meeting was held when Juris Pavtols took up a group calling for Ingrids Guernme, Andri Krumins and Janis Grodal to join.
Over the years, the composition of the Group has been felt on no occasion.
The participants have joined, others have gone down, some have returned.
Above all, however, the desire to assert that Latvian rock is able to live and exist remains unchanged.
"What was missing - the portrayporter, the hair and the beardware, the boys felt very different from the mainstream stereotype," the musician said in a statement.
There have been outstanding musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Krier, Modris Schultant, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brich, Guntars Mucents, Dainis Virga, Thomas Klein and many more.
The entry shall be exhibition free of charge.
An exhibition will take place from 19 August to 30 October.
On Friday 27 August, Liepaja concert garden Baret, winds will take part in the Light's 40th anniversary celebrations "LĪVIfest 2."
For the first time in 8 months, Bulgaria has been inflation.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics accounted for 1% of monthly inflation.
This is the highest rate since 2012 and the first figure above zero since October last year, when it was positive (0. 2%).
The average annual inflation rate after PCI over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0. 8% compared to the previous year.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101. 9% compared to the previous year and the monthly average inflation was 1. 0%.
The inflation rate was -0. 2% since the beginning of the year (in July 2016, compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016, compared to July 2015, was -0. 2%.
In July 2016, prices for the following consumer groups were recorded in July 2016; transport (1. 8%); entertainment and cultural events (6. 3%); hotels and restaurants (1. 2%); domestic goods and services (0. 3%).
The prices fell for clothing and footwear (2. 2%); housing, household appliances and regular home cleaning (0. 5%); health (0. 1%).
Prices remained at the previous monthly level for alcohol and tobacco, for water management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, for communications and for education.
"It is time and the truth upsets."
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church, Archbishop Stankevich, said in an interview with the Independence Party that "if we want to live in power, the Gospel's message must be put at the centre of it."
Because the strength of the truth is greater than the whim of evil.
Many are already on the way to the celebrations of the Holy Landscape in Aglona.
What kind of message will the believers get there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglona has been determined by the Pope's nuncion.
So the content of the main message is also in his hands.
It is also a tradition of tradition that Bishop Janis Bush leads the way for the Cross.
He, too, will form its message.
On the previous day I wrote the service of a Sunday vignette.
Last year I focussed on Laudato si, Pope Francis of Pope, and updated the total house, the Earth theme in Latvia.
This year, of course, I am watching what is happening in the world and I am trying to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church's suggestion that the Gospel message should be put at the centre of life.
It has to be demonstrated that the Gospel responds to the most pressing problems of human life and gives him inspiration for a further journey.
Then it addresses people.
But in Cars, Lamp's discussion, you said that 'it is necessary to return to the idea of a full man'.
What do you mean by that?
Does that mean that a man is turning away from a church's message?
And does a church have such a return resource today?
In the capital of India we are robbing a man dying on the road.
In the capital of India, nobody has learned of a dead man on the road side - it turns out that he has wasted an hour on the side of the road and then robbed, and the BBC is being told.
A man who has been identified as Matimaker is reported to have rated a day and worked as a guard at night.
Matists travelled home in the morning on the road when the light car was shot dead.
The recording of the observeders shows that the driver stepped out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour, when no one wished of a bloody man, he was robbed by a garnder.
Around 90 minutes after the shock, the police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to a hospital where the injuries were caused.
Referring on his candidacy to the Revenue Service of the National Revenue Service (Revenue Service), Head of State Environmental Service Inga Kolegova has rescued the government from the criticism, according to Professor OJ. Skudra, Associate of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Latvia.
The explanation of the lapse about the withdrawal of candidature in connection with the contradictions in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the government from falling.
Smart told LETA that he would not have imagined that Koleg's candidacy would be supported by Unity next week.
So, if the ministers of Unity voted 'no', but Kolegova would then sign up to it, that would lead to a resignation of the government.
The expert believes that, prior to the withdrawal of the candidature, Kolegova has been consulted with Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozola and Prime Minister Mita Kucinski.
At the same time, it was also a concession to Unity, which strongly opposed her candidacy.
Sierra admitted that there are two options for selecting a suitable candidate through a tendering process, or whether a body will continue to lead the Dace in Peleka, as Director General of the Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the finance minister has so far claimed that he is not considering another candidate, it is a nightmare for the Peltic that they should not take part in the contest.
The head of the National Environment Service, Kolegova, has decided to withdraw his candidature for the Revenue Service's Director-General.
On Tuesday the government postponed the approval of Kolegova to the Revenue Service's Director-General on Tuesday for reasons of Unity.
Following the government's decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that he was still ready to be leader of the Revenue Service.
At a later stage, however, thought was changed: on Friday, in a submission to Finance Minister Dane Reizniece-Ozlai, she states he would withdraw his consent for the transfer to the Revenue Service manager and that her choice was not easy.
The press secretary of the Prime Minister, Andrei Vaivars, explained to LETA that there would be a new competition for the vacant Director-General of the Revenue Service.
An accident involving a police car was taking place at the centre of Riga.
This afternoon, a road accident involving a national police car was carried out in the centre of Riga.
The police car with closed sounds and light signals has rushed to a higher Category of Category until Crišt Barona and Dzirnavy cross the street in another car.
Police explained the circumstances, but the initial information showed that the second game had not missed a police car.
In an accident, a woman has suffered.
This year's population in Riga
At the beginning of this year, Riga accounted for 638 784 inhabitants, a 0. 34% lower than in 2015, when 641 000 citizens registered in the capital, LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Authority (CSP).
The Latvian capital, on the other hand, ranks 30th between the European Union (EU) national capitals and the large cities with a population of more than one million.
According to Eurostat data, Riga accounts for the highest proportion of women - the Latvian capital is overwhelmingly first among the biggest cities in Europe, with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three capitals of the Baltic States, there is the highest proportion of women in Europe's biggest cities: 123 in Vilnius, while in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
A warning pictogram shall be issued to LNM.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms - will be deployed to the Latvian National Art Museum (LNM), spokesman Baiba Gailte, spokeswoman for the Riga City Council, told LETA.
There has now been a successful conclusion of a museum vitae defect resulting from the operation of the maeborcers.
Evidence pictograms will be deployed on it in the coming days.
It will tell citizens that the coerings tend to be sick and snow while they must not move around cars as well as toll with bicycles, hybricellites and scrapes.
Ushakov also wrote on the aftermath of this Facebook page, saying that "no security risks are damaged, but" looks uncurious "and scandbordships" will have to be sung. "
Children and the elderly: New children's playgrounds were installed in Riga.
During this summer season, Riga municipality has installed even two new playgrounds in the city, the city of Kirkuk and Cherurich, which are now available for children.
A vast multi-functional machine ship with various fareness elements, bridges, games, trubs and scramans is being installed on the beaches of the Kuclian.
A toy is destined for children of all ages.
Fills and different balancing elements are also installed in agriculture.
The surgery of the furthesis of small same-savers is being stolen at the bank of Daugava, with an eye on the passenger port and the cruise ships which can be seen there.
On the other hand, games of games, batrols, flourishing traces, balance bridges, rocks, rota-bombs and other game elements are being installed on a playground, as well as a gym zone with purse strength and coordination coaches, coaches, etc.
There were frames of rubber falling into the square.
There will be a new, colourless pag-up to the playground on the street.
The hunt shall open the road.
Vehicle Minister Uldis Augulis, the Latvian National Railways (LVC), and representatives of the Latvian construction company Binders and local government representatives today opened the renowned Russian border Russian border (Grebneva) -Rheekne-Daugavpils border (LVC) from Honey to Lithuania's border (156,4-163,05 km).
Roads are a country's visit card, especially for border routes, so it is particularly gratifying to find a reconstructed stage at the border with our southern neighbours.
This is yet another example of the fact that, thanks to the cofinancing of European Union funds, the situation on the main roads of the country is improving.
"As the forecasts suggest, the funds available for roads during this planning period will already be in 2018, and we must think about continuing to maintain the most congested roads in a very good quality and also ensuring the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without Union funding," Uldis Augulis said.
The minister for Transport also pointed out that the proposals put forward by the transport experts on sustainable funding for Latvians will be presented to the government.
The construction works from the hunting to the Lithuanian border (156,4-163,05 km) were launched last year by SIA Binders and continued later this year after a technological break.
The cost of it is €13.5 million (including VAT), a project cofinanced by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"The road design has been fully renovated during the reconstruction phase and next year repairs will be launched from the media to Daugavlpilij," Janis Lange said.
The country's main motorways are under pressure and until 2018, we intend to ensure that all the main roads in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to keep them in good quality by ensuring timely periodical maintenance and to switch to asphalt every 7-9 years.
"Of course, this will require appropriate funding, and all the knees look forward to the proposals put forward by the Expert Group to put the road financing system in order," she said.
The project sorts road connections and lighting to the heart of the media.
Significant land activities have been carried out: in four stages large scale atrocities and extensive mining and embanning works have been corrected, a levelling of the road map, which until now has been very uneven.
Public transport stops will also be restored and a rebuild area for public transport has been rebuilt.
In the past, the road was unsatisfactory and the area was not transparent due to mountainous valley and the old road to a common denominator.
The next construction season is planned to restore the motorway phase from the Daugavpils region until the current reconstruction phase (144,80-156,40km).
This year the LVC is planning to take various forms of work over 1,100 kilometres of national roads.
For all the renovations planned this year on the national road network, see the LVC website at www.enceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight reduction results, the correct choice of food combinations is essential," said Laura Romeraite-Coast of Lithuania.
Furthermore, it is easy during the summer period when fresh fruit, oils and vegetables are growing in our own gardens.
Controlling malnutrition may help not only reduce overweight, but also target the various processes in an ambitious way.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination, providing a lasting sense of cheate and helping to combat fat.
The studies published in the European Clinic Food Log have shown that vinegar has a positive effect on blood alcohol levels and helps us to feel cheerful.
Cash pipari and protein rich meals, such as poultry or proteins, cause not only the feeling of the mouth but also the temptation of big meals in subsequent meals.
This combination of meals can also increase the amount of calorie incomed by up to 35%.
Studies have shown that the Kaje pipari can help to get rid of the fat coating.
Whol is a metabolistic nutrient, and paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
In the absence of sufficient quantities these nutrients may reduce the level of ortizer and therefore the accumulation of fat above the body's middle.
A butter hort accompanied by fresh oils is yet another long and fatty meal for breakfast that is worth being included in the menu.
Old sand and berry contain fibre which, according to Canadian scientists, controls the grey, an appetised stimulation hormonal - and hence a sense of hungry.
In addition, the oils contain polyphenols, which are instrumental in reducing their weight, as well as preventing the formation of fats.
Costs and proteins are also able to do miracles in reducing their weight.
This combination can create feelings of trust.
Costs contain water and fibre and therefore contribute to the sense of cheat.
At the same time, protein is slowing down the digestive process and providing a sense of cheat for a long time.
You can eat a chicken on lunch or produce the protein tracktails out of the finished product and enjoy it with your favourite vegetables.
There will be no product combinations.
There are sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
In contrast, a pot based in vegetables is polysaccharide.
Fruits are broken mechanically, while chemically they do not divide up to a third or fourth stage in the diabed process.
The starch is divided into three different phases starting in the mouth.
It is therefore essential not to eat the food immediately after the meal.
It is "trapped" with other meals where it is not chemically digested and is beginning to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, horses, bananas, computers or other carbohydrate products with citrus, luck, oranges, grape, anaxes or other acid fruits.
Enzyme ptialine, contained in salt, only works in a rosé environment.
Fruit acids impede not only the capture of carbohydrates, but also the fermentation of carbohydrates.
Stop eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk, nuts and milk and a similar combination of proteins in the same mess.
They require different grading juices, each with different strength, characteristics and time to reach the stomach.
Arcture, medusblack, musium and other melons must always eat separately from other meals.
Melons are not distract if they are on the bond with other foodstuffs.
Facts in combination with protein rich products.
Fats form a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said of fat and protein - fat is an obstacle to the supply of protein.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large amount of protein product is consumed, the fat content will be avoided altogether.
This also applies to freshwater: it is not advisable to combine a large quantity of nuts (contained in protein) with a whole source of fat (containing fat).
This combination impedes an effective reduction in weight.
How should I be better prepared?
"Cooking, thermic processing causes a significant loss of nutrients: around 15% and 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products,"
In most cases, nutrients are lost when foodstuffs are harvested.
However, the nutritional value of certain foods is increasing, directly by the weakness.
It is recommended that the liquids that remain after the vegetable oak should be used for coup - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients that have gone into the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
Presers would also be advised to produce them.
Thermal processing significantly increases bioavailability of ptomatoes.
The use of tomatoes in 30 minutes will increase the amount of lyopene by 25%.
Availability of thermal processing also significantly increases bioavailability of betacaromethane found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, the Balkans, freshal potatoes and spreads.
Geographical treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the proteins present, making them more easily legible.
Equally, tertimis-processing of meat and eggs makes it easier to absorb the iron and other minerals present in those products in an organism that is more readily absorbed.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing products can reduce vitamin C from 10% to 90%, while the fibre is not affected.
A combination of tomatoes in combination can increase the intake of iron into the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscular activities.
Our organism absorbs up to 33% of non-blood iron found in plant products such as beans, sheer greens, cereal products than circulating iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and hens.
You can significantly increase the absorption of ne-vascular iron into the body by using non-blood-vascular iron products along with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and coal.
Vitamin C helps to change ne-blood-creative iron in such a way as to make it easier for our body to absorb it.
Iron is necessary for the production of hemotion ecology, which provides the supply of oxygen in musculoskill and brains.
To derive maximum benefit from saliners, add healthy fats such as olive or linseed oil to them.
Add a box of vitamins D to a rich salt or red bacore, which is a good source of calcium, in the preparation of bread in your readings.
Vitamin D increases the quantity of calcium grain absorbed and plays an important role in the process of blending bone.
Oats (as well as other grain grain products), together with sources of vitamin C such as strawberries, upins, avenes and other fruit or coal, help to stabilise cholesterol levels, as well as avoid depreciation of arteries.
The napchat impact of the napchat "footprint"
The napchat representatives say that this filter has been inspired by animated animation, but some commentators claim it is racist.
With this cheap effect, the napchat enables 150 million users to change reality on a daily basis and to play their own identity.
You could turn herself into an anide, a dog or an image that would derive in the ice of Roy Lihushtenham.
Cod is a futile, imaging tool that generates more than 30 million transformed selfia per day.
Any failure quickly becomes public.
The napchat sens have been criticised in the past, with allegations that the app promotes too black sheep or gay faces as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, new lenses have been published that allow users to form their thumb, teeth and footwear, and some critics called it a racist racket of ravour - 'yellow gene'.
The question was also asked as to whether such a contradiction does not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public negavations were burned on Wednesday when the Verge and Motherboard expenditures said that the cheapest effects have been removed from the app.
The company explained that the aim of the lenses is to portray Anime's fathers rather than caricking people of the ravans.
However, people who have experienced racism have brought these effects to the painful stereotypes.
The others categorically denied passion to Ankara.
Greisas Sparapani, an American art student, received a wide resonance on Twitter and she said she was "offensive and uncomfortable, to say the least."
She went on to say that "it is difficult not to notice the obvious similarities between the aziates cartoons and the slow effect.
This shows that the slow effect is not simply yellow face but yellow in the sense of racism.
The napchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless fight for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from business meeting rooms to Holivudor and the devices we use in our daily lives.
And the very large audience of the napchat, which represents different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to these things.
If the napchat lenses create a picture that offends the users, 'these things do not go unnoticed nowadays, "Keitija Jou, a 25-year-old, said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Michel, manager of Medium, deleted his napchat app and advised others to do the same.
In his Medium and telephony interview, she explained that she believed the problem of race is due to the implementation of the napchat employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
They criticise the company's management, consisting mostly of white men and then closing their article with a reference to #Deletesnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so decisions are made: Do they have some other racial representatives, but they do not take the position to express their opinions in a safe and user-friendly way," she said.
Others share her view, and Mr napchat has not replied to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many workers come from a different race, arguing that it is a private company.
The napchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but his representative discovered that the company had contracted a staff specialist who will focus on including racial minorities, which are not well represented and will facilitate inclusion in the company.
But he will not update his napchat account, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that it is wrong."
The Court of Congress declares that the reports of the Islamic State have been distorted by military officials.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Congress notes that representatives of the US Central Bank have made reports describing the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in a more optimistic manner than is actually the case.
According to the analysts of the central command service, the analysts were generally dissatisfied with the interim report of the Republican Party of the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defence Financing, pointing out that they were controlling reports on American progress in the fight against the Islamic State.
A central counterpart, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampere, Florida, which monitors the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of this report shows that the intelligence reports approved by senior Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is; the fact is that the facts were regularly misrepresented, illustrating better achievements than any other intelligence analysis.
California's Republican representative, Ken Kalvert, tells us: 'The behaviour of Centcom is unacceptable: our soldiers are the ones suffering if our policymakers get false reports'.
Centcom management errors are found at the highest management level of the organisation.
This 10-page report details the existing problems in the reflection and analysis of the central commandbook and analyses of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide irreparable evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration would have made reports misguided, it shows that the management of Centcom has put some pressure on analysts to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State (known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report shows that in the first half of 2015, the central government press release, announcements and reports recorded the situation in a considerably more positive light than was actually the case.
For example, representatives of Centcom have publicly declared that Mosul's recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, still under Islamic State control.
Republica's Republican party's representative, Mahdi Pompeo, said in his statement: "A period of several months enquiry makes this clear."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, central government officials of the US Central Bank made reports showing the weakest of ISIS in Iraq than they actually did.
The Republican Party created a working group, knowing that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic state is being distorted.
As soon as the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new discoveries in the case.
The Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence carries out an investigation into the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
The members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Regulatory Committee released their own report on Thursday, in which they accepted some of the conclusions of the Republican Party Working Party.
In his report, the representative of the Democratic Republic of Democratic Republic, Mr Adams Schiff, said that in 2014 and 2015, Centcom too restricted the preparation of reports by the intelligence services regarding the ISIS and Iraqi security forces.
Mr Schifa explains that this process' stopped the dissemination of information ', worsened the ethics of the analysts and' disseminated facts that are not true '.
But members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on the Centcom analysts to draw up reports according to "predetermined or political."
The Daily Beast published preliminary results of the Congress's investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times said that the Pentagon General Inspectorate had opened an inquiry following a hearing of Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Patrik Evans said that Pentagon would not comment on the Congress report until the investigation is under way.
He went on to say that sometimes the experts sometimes interpret difficult data, and the Defence Ministry and the intelligence government are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not just about whether the American bombardment campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But the charges of last year call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on the reports issued by the Central Administration on the military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Criticism of Islamic State reconnaissance is reminiscent of the events of more than ten years ago, when the Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregorijs Harsh, has published a study saying that George W. Bush's administration started the war in Afghanistan with too little thought of its possible consequences.
Ambassakesh also played an important role in detecting Islamic State reconnaissance.
Last year, official representatives reported that, contrary to public reports, air strikes in Islamic State oil plants had not significantly impaired the financial position of the terrorist group as they had constructed temporary factories to sell oil on the black market.
The Times announced in September that this discovery did not come out of the heads of the Central Administration.
Meanwhile, General Loid Ostins III of the Centcom Commander received harsh criticism, as many laws makers considered that the war reports describe the situation too positively.
General Ostins was on holiday in April and has been replaced by General Joseph Votels.
The United States won the fourth win in a row in the United States with the United Kingdom's hockey win.
The day after the victory over Japan with a win of 6: 1, on Thursday Keitija Bama made the first two goals for the US Department of Women's Hockey team, when the Americans won the Indian team with a result of 3: 0.
Five goals in two games are an unforceful achievement, but a 27-year-old Bam said that he could not remember that she had ever had that.
She said, 'I have no idea.'
I am not one of those people who share their gates.
But she knows that the Americans' outcome at the Olympic Games is 4: 0, which gives them no choice in their group with Britain, which won't win a 2-0 result on Thursday.
Britain and the US will meet Saturday to play the first round of the last game.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter and the game will only determine which team will take the first place within six team teams and the second.
The winner from the first place will avoid a little longer from meeting the strong Dutch sample, which is the leader of the second group.
Although the game of Saturday did not take place, the Americans have already given a surprise, with the arrival of the last place between 12 teams in London four years ago.
There was a team with Bama
She grew up in the Flobelt, his first cup was in her hands for the first time (her oldest daughter's sisters had already dealt with this type of sport in Recalanta) and joined the national selection when she was 16 years old, becoming a random list of young players.
She was not on the 2008 Olympic Games because he did not enter the finger.
Yet 2012 was a failure for her and her team.
The Englishman Kregs Parham was appointed for the following year and everything changed for the better.
Mr Biden called it "cultural, mentality and physical change."
We did not invest as much work in London as it is now.
We have changed everything.
In the fourth game Bami opened the game with a gateway at the first half of a close distance from a close distance.
India started the game without victory in his account, but their output was very lively and held minimal results for 0: 1 until the end of the third period, when the city again scored its gates.
She entered a bomb attack on the left side of the field, then he looked at the middle of the square and sent a bomb to the gates of the enemies, driving the Americans under 2: 0.
Meles Gonzalesa scored another gateway in the middle of the fourth period.
This was the first year of the dry game of the US valve Guard, Jeky Brugge, with each of the first three games being put on a single gateway.
She is running out.
And so too.
"We are going very well now," he said, but as good as Saturday.
Period of the period of depression is the "reasonable malte"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as President, Frank Delano Rūtrait sat in the ovation room to defeat.
President Rūta has been tasked with fine culinary debills such as zoos stows, or fuela and Merlan bits of turtles.
On Friday, however, his mess was more wealthy: blank eggs from tomatoes, potato fixes and dessert waves.
Jesus Ziegelmane says: "This is a way of showing solidarity in cooking with people who have been very hard."
"This is also a message to the Americans to eat."
A couple of Brooklyn Heights district is a historic historian.
The last book "Coastal Drought" describes Chinese cuisine in America, but Ziegelmane describes life through his book '97 Fasles' in the easten of Manhattan.
Their new collaborative work, the Intelligent Misal, published on Tuesday by the Minister for Harper, is a story of American ethics in a time of great depression.
While showing some solidarity at gastronomy, they were messed together with Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, in a simple lunch estuff that is in the area of the Flatiron, which was in 1929, when the great depression started.
The 54 year old, Mrs Ziegelmanes, ordered a butter with a melted cheese and dried olives, while 57 year old Kou ordered a tura, potato starter and vegetable oils.
When the reporter commissioned a fake green, a couple said his choice was very relevant to the conversation over the Great Depression.
Mrs Ziegelmanes told the House that the counterfeit man was very popular.
There was a peanuts lag, a liver sack and a bottomy lag.
They were made from basic components and other ingredients that enriched them.
Imagine as it is - to eat so many peanuts to be at lunch.
Mr Kou asked.
"It seemed likely that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the first years of the recession, the American table was tantamount to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their male workers and lunch, lunch and dinner were given fresh passes.
In the first World War, it was the Americans who sent the Europeans a meals: the 'wrong meal' describes how the Americans were adapting to the circumstances when America suddenly ceased to be a land of abundance.
"At that time the food became the main focus of the American people on a daily basis," said Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on the subject.
Ziegeline said that "unknown meals like a fake bird" and "disturbances" were "an excellent way to use the surpluses," said Ziegelson.
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the main ingredient of American meals, has now become an extremely rare luxury goods.
At a time when the number of calories and food was more important than taste, new unseen formations were born.
In an old book, Mrs Ziegelmanes found a recipe for mandating small butter butter.
Mr Kou added, 'This was not a popular pennutary to dinner table'.
Mrs Ziegelmans says: 'It was surreal'.
Peanuts butter and baked metal are incompatible.
Many of the home market recipes applied to difficult times.
Domestic economists such as Louise Stenley, Head of the Federal Department of Household Finance from 1923 to 1943, set public eating habits that had not been experienced not before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and prescriptions in newspapers and magazines, they suggested that households should be "confused" and accept the challenges of turning the macaroni and the carrot micro into a spiritual meal.
"Intelligent Malta" is a historic sleepy barley.
Evidence of the government's attitude towards its hungry citizens, such as President Herberta Humder's attitude, is particularly interesting.
Though in public he spoke of his humiliary childhood and eating in Aiogo, in fact he was lying as a finer mild of what he had become.
Mr Kou says: 'he liked a European kitchen like a cucumber of cucumbers.'
He was eating almost into gold guigade wearing a lunch gnaked.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Rūta would have made the same mistake, unless his wife Eleonora had advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book told reporters that Rūta landed a domestic worker who did not learn to prepare to eat, so the White House became a place where one of the most volatile meals in Washington had been served, but also the least prepared meals. "
As soon as the country's economy came apart, most depression colonies disappear.
But we continue to focus on calories and nutritional value and on how science can be used in gastronomy, Mrs Ziegelson added.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of the eating habits of Mrs Kiegelmane, for example, why she was unable to throw the mess.
"She really feared to throw away the mess," he said.
Mrs Ziegelmanes said, 'She has actually furthered the people'.
There was once a incident involving wind turmoil.
When we had eaten up at the Eisenberga Venstuary, a couple of writers took off a desert from a Finns home: a pound bean messed by President Rūtag on lunch.
"It's a pickery," said Ziegelmans, adding that at that time there was a common habit of giving modest meals a shell name.
There is no half-cream, only dried, little meal, sugar, water and a cinating.
They were all impatient to install the flag in the brown masse on the plates.
Inventually, it was not as bad as that.
Mr Kou burned a few more coumatoes.
After listening to an experienced "economist," he told the wife: "That would be a nice boy."
The legal costs of the battle with Merck for the Hepatitis C Patent will be repaid for legal expenses.
The Jury decided that Gilead Sciences Inc had the right to be reimbursed for the services it paid in connection with the termination of the Hepatitis C patent against Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted with a 200 million pound penalty for breaking the two Merck patents that it threatened with regard to the successful Soviei and Harvoni's tablets, when the US federal judge identified irregularities in Merk's operations, such as the passing of oath and other unethical practices.
US District Judge Beet Labsons Fück said Gilead had the right to claim compensation for legal costs incurred in this case.
Merck is trying to gain a position on the market against Gilead, which is dominated on the market by a new generation of Hepatitis C medicines, which is effective in 90% of acute diseases.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck brought together each other in an attempt to obtain ownership of the newly developed active component in soypbuyir, the main component of Gilead medicine.
The forces supported by the US claim to have completely overtaken control of the city of Manicia from the Islamic State.
The forces behind the US-backed forces have completely removed the city of Manera at the Turkish border and the latest Islamic State soldiers have fled the city on Friday, the spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city from the last opponents of the opposition who have not left the city.
They have freed more than 2 000 hostage civilians who were captured by combatants, including Sharraf from the military council of SDS's associate Manager.
"Today, the city is under complete control and we are carrying out fighters," Reuters told the Reuters.
Clinton's income reached USD 10.75 million in 2015 and some paid 34,2 percent of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton announced the 2015 Tax Declaration, which shows that the candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential term and her husband deserved 10.75 million dollars this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34,2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton has donated USD 1 million, mainly to its Clinton charity, while former President Bill Clinton has earned some USD 5.3 million on his work in the National Departament, published in cooperation with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election rally led to US Virginian Senator Tims Kein and his wife, Anna Holland, released his tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Timber Kein continue to set new standards for financial transparency," said Clinton campaigner Jenifera Palami in his statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind various pretexts and reservations, so that promises to disclose their tax information should not be honoured.
The publication of nominal tax information is a record practice for the US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
Trump's business leader Trump and his lawyer referred to the audit of the Public Accounting Service as a reason for not revealing tax information.
"It's a move," said Clinton campaigner Ian Sami on his Twitter entrance.
On Thursday, Trump's Special Advisor Michael Kohens told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish the tax information before completing the audits.
Trump's critics, including the Republican candidate for the Republican party, Mitt Romney and other Republicans, claim that his relinquishment raises questions about his real estate size, the amounts of donations and the other commitments of his business, including its commitment to Russia.
Clinton came up to the fire and published a video on Friday, where several influential Republicans demanded Trump make his tax information public.
She referred back to this issue at an economic speech in Michigan on Thursday.
She told the crowd "he refuses to do what the rest of the presidential candidates have been doing for several decades."
Politico tells us that during the 1990s, Trump has paid little or no money at all and, on Friday, the author of the New York Times writes that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are a key issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, supporting a proposal from the billionaire Varena Bafeta, is promoting the idea that anyone who earns more than USD 1 million a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, Clinton's speaking time at Omaghai, Abraham, where his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway was also present, Bafet called on Trump to exchange tax declarations.
The Bafesto said that he was also carrying out audits of the Revenue Service and Trump was afraid of the voters, not the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has provided tax information up to 2007.
Clinton has now lived in the city of Chile, New York and has paid an average federal tax rate of around 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a total tax rate of around 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars per income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton has received $10,000 in dividends.

Jewish filmmaker criticises the Hotel in Berlin on the removal of Israel's long-distance contract at the request of an arker - RT Reports
A French film director of Jewish raised a storm in social media when it found that no Israeli divisional code was not available at the Kempinski Bristol's hotel in Berlin.
Lord Lancman, director of the Holocaust Shoah, did not hide his discontent with the Holocaust Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit Lancmans tried to find an Israeli blockshop on the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries which can be called directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that, in 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been tortured and destroyed?
Writing Lancmans.
Instead, the hotel of Kempinski Bristol offers a call to the country through its call centre.
The regime asked for an explanation from hotel staff.
Lancmans writes that the answer I received "shocked him."
Hotel administrator explained that "this is a deliberate hotel management decision."
The cause of the code was even furthered by the film director.
"The majority of guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be lifted," Lancman cites an explanation of a hotel official.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said the Israeli ambassador to Germany Jakovs Hadas-Handelsmans had described the case as a "great shame."
We are amazed and shocked by the incident.
This is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany is precisely the same hotel network.
This clarification is not necessary.
The adviser said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions."
This event also gained a fairly wide resonance, including on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that Kempinski's hotel has simply legalised Arab clients.
Another newspaper said to be ashamed, pointing out that the hotel was located on the side of Kurfurstendamm along the side of synagoza.
The Der Spiegel reported that the hotel itself had quickly rejected all allegations, saying it was "misunderstood" and apologised to Lanctica.
"We have not had any direct instructions to withdraw Israel from the national numberlists," Suddeutsche Zeitung cites Kempinski's representative.
And add that once again the code is added to the list.
The police use rubber bullets and tear gas for protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashes took place on Thursday in São Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in a demonstration against reforms of the government's education system.
The police used rubber bullets and tear gas to students.
The problems began when the ombudsmen tried to obey the students, which resulted in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to show their displeasure at the reforms of the education system.
The proposal by the Governor of San Marino, Geraldo Alckmaa, aims to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be resettled to other schools with a view to saving money.
Some demonstrators marched on the walls with messages to the interim President, Maroš Temert.
This protest was only a few days after the previous protest when students gathered together to support the deplanted president, Dilma Rousefai, for which impeachment was voted by Senate.
Sean Kelt Spoers finishes first to cross the UK for gold medals cycling
Kelt Siners from Scotland wrapped the first match between the men's cycling team last night, and the British team safeguarded his team of champions at the London Champion 2012.
The 23 year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in this race by making the legendary Scottish Seru Krissa Hoa proud of the favourite New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a hasty victory when he won five of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated it at the World Cup in London, although the Holy had ceased his career as athletes.
The problems were at the stage between the Beijing and London Olympics as they had to replace the experienced starter specialist James Stafu.
They succeeded in doing so at the last minute.
When the Holy left, his place was filled by Ki-Emadi and Met Krampton.
British coaches laid hope for the Spurse, seeing the potential that he later proved.
Hinyan, Kenny, champions between Hoya and Skiners four years ago, who fled the Olympic qualife record, while the team of New Zealand was better hit.
The British trio won gold medals, however.
Hinds were badly drunk after his face, Kenya led the way and the Sciners safeguarded this leadership.
The change of strategy played an important part in the victory, as Hindu traveled with more carry-overs to allow Kenya, and the Spurse in particular, to drive more quickly.
The boy watched the match as a BBC and took the eyes of the Skinera, Kenya and Hindesa at the moment when they were going to the podium.
The 23-year-old glass said, 'This was an immense honour'.
I am doing everything to defend my name.
In the villa we set the Olympics and we wrote the World Cup.
That was simply unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After the victory, with Kenya and Hours in the Olympics in London in 2012, Hinyan knew that he was deliberately falling on the road following the unfortunate start of the war.
Later he refuted the comment and the British competitor had no power to prove the opposite.
This time, there were no such incidents.
Hindu said: "British flags in the tribes recalled London."
Over the past 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory in the Olympic Games was indeed special.
One coin will be raided by a country that acquired seven of ten gold medals on cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is a team of teamwork over the last five months, the five days ahead will be very exciting.
Given the result of Kenya, he could indeed repeat Hoja's success in obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
In Kenya, it would mean six gold and one silver medal, and Kenya was born on 23 March (it seems that it is British's sacrosanct, as Stras Regret, Mo Farave and Rodgers Banisters were also born this day).
A Hoi was born on that date.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old sportsman from Bolivia said: "I do just enjoy it all at the moment.
Team trips are always the best.
Because then you can win with the teammates.
Honestly, it is a little londe to win. "
Hindu said: "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed by the armed forces."
It was the only fight for the medals on that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Vigy, Vigy, Eds Klensium, Steve Burks and Ovein Douls had indicated the fastest period of qualification for four kilometres.
Their time was 3: 51.943
The World record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3: 51.659.
The first round and finalist will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigy will definitely be the focus of attention.
Yesterday, before a qualifying trip, he had a disagreement with the commission when the judges called him to measure his growth.
Laura Trota, Josanna Rovsela Schanda, Elinor Barkere and Keitija Archibalda from Milngavia led a new record of 4: 13.260.
The British delegation hopes that a British bicycle team will pick up the medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Bearing in mind the excellent and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone is expecting the same achievement at the Rio.
Meanwhile, the scenes have gone in different ways, following accusations of sexism and insulting, while Holland and Victoria Bendt are closing their career.
However, as the first cycling races began, Britain as a whole seems unlikely to reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland slaughterhouse is becoming uncertain because an ambitious treaty has been interrupted.
Aluminium slaughterhouses and hundreds of its employees in Portlena, Victoria, have become uncertain as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the suspension of cooperation.
This Communication builds on the plans of the Victoria Government to stop subsidising the energy company, which is vitally important for the company to continue to operate.
A 20-year subsidy will be suspended in November.
As a result, more than 2 000 workers in the Portland Portland are at risk.
Up to 2000 both direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
In addition, it will also have unforeseeable side-effects, as the slaughterhouse consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity supply in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed down the station of the Point Henry, which led to a break in the England power plant.
The Portland slaughterhouse is doing a loss and can be shut down.
These events have been the result of several years of speculation about the rise in the dollar's dollar and the cost of factory production.
The factory energy supplier AGL, supplying energy from his Lower Yang A power plant in Latroubes Isoya, says that the other three owners are likely to cease their contracts.
Most of the power stations are owned by Alcoa and Alumia, and the company's' CITIC 'and the Japanese "Marubeni Corp" holding company are among the companies.
"AGL counts on the continuation of the Portland factory, which would mean further energy supplies at the battlefield," he said.
AGL reported that contracts were so-called "risk limiting contracts," which is expected to come into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a twelve-month validity period and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL" intends to receive revenue from these contracts also in the 2017 fiscal year, "said the company's representative.
Starting from the 2018 fiscal year, the potential impact on profits shall be limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale prices for electricity.
AGL says that $187 million of losses have already been estimated in their projections, providing for these contracts to be interrupted.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts would not affect Alcoa's ability to continue down or supply energy to the slaughterhouse.
In 2010, the US company concluded that it had contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but that it would be interrupted in November; the company does not explain why it will suspend the cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about the alleged closure of the Portland slaughterhouse in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, because of the sector's weak economy.
AGL CEO Steve Mikelson said last week that 600 megavatus and Too 900 megavatus were used in Portland every year.
If the two plants were to leave the energy market, then energy demand would fall considerably.
And that would not be good at all.
The community legal centre rejects 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 people are rejected every year, and the budget will deteriorate further as the budget decreases.
Three out of five people in Kharsland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal eviction - are denied free legal aid and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only become worse as a result of reduced funding.
From June next year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than has been the case until now.
James Farele, Director of the Kharsland Legal Centre, said that the latest Association Report of the National Legal Centre states that legal aid is now being denied to thousands of people in need.
Mr Fille said that if this decision had not been lifted, the situation would only become worse.
He also says: 'The legal centre of Kharsland is chronically underfunded, which means that the assistance is refused to thousands of people in need'.
People who aspire to an end to violent relationships, people with deep debts, families suffering from divorce, workers under dishonest dismissal - all these people have a legal problem and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, which means that several thousand Kharsland inhabitants will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and the Cathosland Senator, George Brandis, to stop cutting funding immediately, so that the people in need of legal aid can obtain it.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to increase the level of legal aid to the average national level.
Now is the time to turn our attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and the government of Palazir to invest in this important area.
Donald Trump's campaign has been brought to court as one of the workers dragged into a firearm.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign organizers have been taken to court as they have failed to get information that the manager of Operation North Carolina has opened a firearm against a worker when they travel into one car in February.
This incident was described in a court request made on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former campaigner of campaigner.
Suordini said he had waited months for an internal review of the case, but understood that this would not be the case.
Dordini claims to complain at the end of the decade, Dordini says in his complaint.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaigner management, Gordini learned that at least four people had experienced the same.
"The arms do not have to shoot to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Only two days before this case was brought, the nominee for the Republican Party caused a scandal to tell people that "people of the Second Amendment, i.e. owners of arms and enthusiasurists, could act if his rival, Hillary Clinton, and his elected judges could win the elections.
Trump's campaign said that the media had broken his words from the context, and he never fled anyone to violence.
In his claim, Gordini wishes to recover compensation from campaigner for negligent supervision, but from the Philippines for attacking, using illegal guns and creating emotional stress.
Trump's representative Houl Hiksa did not comment immediately.
The Philippines have failed to communicate.
WCCB - Scharlova Local News Agency says the Philippines has recently left the campaign.
Nor has it been possible to call his consultancy firm, the 'Innovation Advisory Services'.
Republican candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition of paste and sports festival in Khartoum.
On Saturday, in Kharia, for the first time, people gathered for the orders of the orders and sports festivals.
After a celebration of ten years, it was decided this time that Easter's festive season would cease to exist.
A new page has now been moved.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not traditional and too serious because, for example, the shots had to be dropped, the shoot air, the flash of the left hand, the 'bumbotics' at all have not been at all in the Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, successful and attacked he was.
After the sports games, everyone pulled into the open-air industry, where the festive season broke out.
In the meantime, there was also a 'chille angle', where small children could break out in inflated deductions and acquire a new image in the face of the face.
A news that could also become a tradition was a pattern of driveway involving both tractors and motorcycles.
Anga Ziķe-Skager, head of the Khartoum custom, was all concerned, who wished a nice rest and dry time, but rained it but was unable to obstruct anything.
The sands continued with the Welcome of the most recent inhabitants of Khartoum.
It is very good that the paste has enriched five girls and one putch.
"Rudolye" of the "Rudolów" of the elderly, the "Odas" of the various peoples, and the Or jewee of young people, were the forerunners of the foreigners from Engures.
And it's nothing to see how the wet stage was going to happen to me.
Of course, the famous acturer of Janis Jarane and Dainis Propt, who was once again the Milk Nablor Cleante Krpan, as well as the indebted wife of Berzvili from the fishermen, have enjoyed pleasure.

Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only contribute to prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also to the whole of the country.
This, in my view, makes Heathrow a very attractive place, as was the case in London in 2012, where we invested a huge amount of work so that all the regions of the country would benefit from the Olympic Games.
The put-forford and the Belt won a huge amount of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again, providing local people and businesses with business opportunities close to Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs, and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
Just as in the London Olympics in 2012, there will again be people who believe that the challenge is too great and that the expansion of Heathrow is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be prepared to prepare for the Olympics and that this would be a failure of the world.
The sceptics were wrong for 2012, and they will not be right in the case of Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits society as a whole, not individual individuals.
Enlargement represents an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, €211 billion of economic growth, creating the ground for both employment and experience in this airport and the whole of Britain.
An excellent team has been working in Heathrow, which has created an upgrade of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure, entering the medium and the budget from the terminal 5, which has been built for five years from the site as the best airport terminal in the world to a terminal 2 fitted between the two more intensively used runways in the world.
Now they are ready to create a third runway that will be financed by €16 billion of private investment.
The London Olympics 2012 was a great success and I am sure that this will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Niton is a member of the board of Heathrow and former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman sticks to the great way of trying to commit suicide.
The rest of the night featured on the road.
The police are trying to find witnesses to an accident where she crossed over several cars at the early morning of Thursday morning.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo Canton.
The Vo Cantona police report said that desperate to commit suicide, a woman had learned to the road in the dark, where several cars entered the road.
Clearly, trying to kill myself, the victims, the 49-year-old man, were leaving a number of cars, including the heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
A number of drivers involved in the accident have already provided evidence, while others have not yet been cleared, and the police are calling for the appearance of drivers and casualty witnesses.
Criminal investigation has also started in the case, which is a logical step in this case, as a lawyer, Gilles Hofstellers, herself wrote at the Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid clashes?
Hofstellers added: "It will be clear by the prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have taken place over the past 5 years have shown that none of the drivers will be brought to justice.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone to the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that there would be a pedestrian in the middle of night, a newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted with killing off the delight when she drove in August 2014 a man who was on the A1 road close to Paijernes in midnight.
The remaining 22 year-old victim was drunk and then noticed to sleep on the road.
The court concluded that the police officer who was on the way to the accident occurred in an appropriate manner, and the judge admitted that the man on the road was "completely unpredictable and extraordinary."
Anyone who has information on the incident near Morges on Thursday calls for contact with the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The internet is collecting signatures for the organisation of a new head for the Revenue Service of the Revenue Service.
The collection of signatures for the organisation of a new head of State Revenue Service (Revenue Service) has been launched on the "Awaaz.org" site.
The petition, addressed to the ministers of the National Alliance (NA) and the Greens / Farmers' Union (Greens / Farmers), indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional card process.
The site was established on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of designing the Revenue Service Director of the Revenue Service, Ingas Kolegova, is non-transparent and unprofessional.
This is reminiscent of the best Soviet tradition of the Soviet Union.
It damages public administration and once again makes society frustrated in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates," the text says.
Its author, Janis B., has pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for choosing the post of Kolegova.
Nor is it clear what the applicant's entries are to the Revenue Service.
The study points out that the State Chancellery should form a new open competition where professional candidates are actively addressed, staff selection specialists and adequate remuneration are offered.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola officially nominated Kolegova to head the Revenue Service, but the government was due to approve his appointment this week but all ministers of Unity voted against, so the question was postponed for a week.
Samoilovs: If we lost, so I played bad.
Alexander Samoilovs, Janis Samoilovs and Janis Schumins had hoped for the award in Rio de Janeiro, while Samoilovs said after withdrawal from the tournament.
Oliveira and Peat Solbergam have lost their lives in the four-year leading sport forum on Thursday.
In the three games, Latvian sportsmen won one victory, but the ratio was even two.
Then there was the ratio of the three couples, which, according to the strong loss suffered by this massacre, was the Latvian dutyard.
"We were in the lead at the first six, but out of 16: 15 it remained for 16 points," Schymont remembered.
I do not even know how we left the remaining sixth.
You can't play it.
Afterwards in the second round, everything was fine and managed to break the game in the sixth sitting, and it should have been a good foundation for the third round as well.
It started in a similar way, but after the parties changed, only one team had the result.
We had too many errors in the attack.
All teams were similar in the sub-group, nearly three in all the matches, so small points were important.
"It ought to play a better role, not to have 3-4 points in a row," the athlete said.
We knew the cane would be serted.
"I was at the end of the last season, with 1-2 points in the second, and the third on + 4 already played a game."
We tried to show the best game.
They came at times.
I did not look at the situation before the match, but it was a good idea that we needed as many small points as possible.
"If we lose, so I played bad," said Samoilovs.
Evanger waited a good server and was also fairly well in the first six, but the third opened serve to serve and was difficult to form an attack.
In my turn, I made a lot of mistake precisely at the Peat Reserve, but it had to be dealt with.
Samoilovs said that, contrary to the previous speaker today, athletes had no nervousness.
"We walked up, we played, there was protection, but there had to be a better place for admission," the athlete said.
"They played a good game and in the end came to the tank."
Prior to the tournament we said straight away that the loose was the most convenient one could have been.
We had the chance to fight for the first place as well, but I did not even get out of the group.
"All of us were expecting the medal and we have come from myself, and then there is no difference between the 25th place or the fourth," Samoilovs said, adding that the duplicant will continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one Turkish.
Samoilovam in Rio de Janeiro was already in the third Olympic Games in Rio, where he was in Beijing in 2008, while he was playing with Miss Roza four years ago in London.
Meanwhile, this was the second launch in the Olympics.
"Tenergo" follows the process of opening up the gas market also from a potential trader's position.
Latvia's Latvian company Tenergo is following the process of opening up the gas market both from a consumer and a potential trader, "Ivita Bidere told the company's press secretary.
"The decision on whether Latvia will join the gas market as a trader in the future will determine what gas market design and legal framework will be created."
"For our part, therefore, we are actively engaged in the creation and commencement of legislative acts, and we are presenting our proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency BNS has already wrote to the BNS that the Economic Department of the Economy (Treasury), in cooperation with the Public Service Regulators Commission and the Energy company Latvijas Gaze, has drawn up a draft Cabinet draft rules to change the existing principles of the natural gas market by providing the right of natural gas users to freely choose a natural gas trader on 3 April 2017.
As part of its work on the regulation of the natural gas market, it aims to make the natural gas trade process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Thus, the most efficient and user-friendly solution to servicing is the trader's central model, where all activities relating to customer service are served by the trader, one contract, one invoice and a single source of customer service while leaving the distribution system operator the technical details of the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the area of electricity trade.
Recalling the gradual market opening for domestic users - even after 3 April 2017, household customers who do not want to opt for another natural gas trader will be able to continue to obtain natural gas from the current trader at a regulated price, thus becoming a connected user.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to those users at a regulated price is determined by the public," the ministry said.
Operators, on the other hand, will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas sales contract.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas contract, for certain periods, natural gas sales will be provided by the natural gas trader on a fixed price to economic operators.
The draft Cabinet Regulation details the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall govern the supply of natural gas by users, the safe use of the natural gas system, the arrangements for the trader, the public trader, the system operator, user and customers "supply in the event of disruption of natural gas supply and arrangements for the supply of natural gas to the customers concerned by the public service.

Minister: next week sees an increase in remuneration for the Revenue Service's Director-General.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens / Farmers) next week plans to raise the remuneration of Directors-General of the State Revenue Service (Revenue Service) and government coalition partners.
Reizniece-Ozola told journalists on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Revenue Service's Director General should be addressed urgently, so as to make it more attractive for potential re-tenders.
There will also be talk next week about changing the conditions for tender.
The ministry also stressed that she did not have any specific candidate to address the vacant post.
At the same time Reizniece-Ozola said that Inga Kolegova, head of the National Environment Service, would have been a good director of the Revenue Service.

Kolegova also pointed out that the discussion on her candidature had multiplied the contradictions among the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It also reported that former Revenue Service Director General Inara Petersone left office at the end of June.

The company's management report states that in 2015, the company was operating losses resulting from a number of reasons, including the continued lack of operational funds from the Baltic market, leaving the Blue Belt with closed contracts without the possibility of complying with them.
The company did not have sufficient means to purchase higher volumes of cheaper raw materials and to obtain a discount.
The withdrawal of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing projects to support European Union structural funds, which would have enabled the factory to buy new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Likewise, the financial producers of the company were adversely affected by the rise in commodity prices during the last year and the reluctance of customers to pay more for goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016 customers were able to accept price changes and were prepared to purchase goods at the top prices," the company's management said.
In 2015, the Blue Belt opened negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the moving and immovable property of the company.
Investors have already been dit's largest creditor, Unicredit Lasing, where the parties have studied and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the operation and development of the company were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan initiated in 2014 and 2015.
This plan involved improving and optimising the technological processes leading to higher productivity and capacity for production.
"A number of equipment has been bought that provides more speed in production," the company's management said.
"Blue light" management notes that the equipment bought in 2016 will allow the company's factory to fulfil such contracts, which had not been possible until now.
The first batch of products that will be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As articles of intent on the sale of the product have already been signed, everything produced will be sold according to intent protocols.
The new product will increase the turnover by around €300 000 a month, "the company's management said.
The company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
In 2016, the Blue Belt sent the first experimental container to Israel, extended the outlets to Cyprus and signed a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the US this September.
All these measures result in the company planning to increase turnover.
In 2014, the Blue Belt worked with a turnover of EUR 6.347 million and a loss of €5.113 million.
The Blue Book was founded in 1997 and has a share capital of €1.156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian individuals - Mihail Kaidanovs (89. 11%) and Igor Shiršt (10. 89%).
Welcome to the Grand Museum at the museum and take part in a press conference.
The city of the career and inspiration of the career and inspiration of the traditional cinema strange, Zar Leandela, can be seen.
The village of Zorian Lendeavours in Riga in 1924 was destined to be fatal in Riga in 1924.
Perhaps it was the accidental omission in Riga that became the fatal milestone in the creative way of the Ivory, facing the world's reputation.
Riga had a warm memory and hoped to travel to Riga, but unfortunately those hopes had not been met due to the start of the Second World War.
It will be possible, through a show of play, to have this meeting in Riga, 2016, and the prominent role of Zorian Leanderes will be felt by Catholic Caevica.
There are wide traffic restrictions in the area of Aglona.
Ducks will close their transit traffic via several national motorways in the town of Aglona from 12 August to 15 August.
The restrictions will not apply to Aglona clocks and public transport.
It should be noted that at the P62 Krég-de Madona (0.80-4,000k-km) motorway, only public transport and pedestrians will be able to cross into a clock in Aglona.
For other road users, traffic will be covered by a driveway - a scheme in the accompanying file.
Traditionally, a large number of participants, including those on Sunday, come to these holidays.
Drivers must therefore be particularly careful, because there will be intensive destrian movements towards Aglona on various road routes.
We encourage drivers to be aware of the traffic restrictions introduced, to comply with the traffic organisation, and to take account of possible long journeys.

There has been a sexual assault on two children in entertainment parks in England.
Bashola police are searching for the assassination of "Daily Mail," who sexually used two six-year-old girls at his leisure park, Legoland.
The police asked parents to study the photographs received in the entertainment park, as they could see the attacker.
Girls have told the parents of what happened.
The men were unfamiliar with girls, white skin colours and about 20 years old.
Which activists are the buildings of a German public service broadcaster?
The 30-year-old Kurdish group held a public service broadcaster WK building in Düsseldorf on Thursday evening, where an almost two-hour protest movement was held, according to German police.
The demonstrators who came with their posters scandled various slogans trying to draw attention to the current situation in Turkey.
The officials said the demonstrations were generally calm and protesters had, after the staff's request, voluntarily left the building.
The insurer will pay compensation on Wednesday to the passengers of the cancelled flight.
If Insurance has paid trip insurance to a family on Wednesday 10 August, Riga Airport cancelled the trip, which had to abandon the planned visit of the music festival.
On 11 August, an application for reimbursement was received in the case of insurance from a client.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but because this was not possible on Wednesday, flights cancelled at the airport, the customer was charged for a nightgoat reservation, which could no longer be waived, as well as the purchase of festival tickets of €204.
The money spent on aircraft tickets, on the other hand, has been promised to the clients by the airline.
If insurance cover all journeys, an average of 15% of cases have paid for the suspension or cancellation of their trip.
"These events compensate for costs of buying, forging or exchanging tickets, as well as for night bookings," Dagmar ROlin, Chair of the Insurance and Risk Insurance Committee said.
As you know, on the evening of 10 August, a private plane planted on the VRIGA, a number of departing flights, and a number of incoming flights had to be redirected to other airports.
Due to the difficult repair of the city, a man is under the ceiling and forced to leave the homes.
Dmitry Saidjavich turned his neighbour to the cape from the Greeks in his apartment and there is no certainty that it is safe to stay in the apartment.
The problem is that my neighbours made arbitrary construction and my apartment was damaged by the ceiling.
Then I informed the Riga construction board, the House of Houses and other organisations.
The building board said that we are not an operational service and we have no expert.
"The owner of the house must go to the Engineering Union of Latvia and there will be an expert from there," Dmitry said.
The expert in charge arrived, had taken the incident and admitted that the surcover was unsatisfactory.
However, since the first submission of Dmitrier, a month has passed and, by the beginning of this week, nobody was able to answer whether the invasion of the apartment was not life-threatening.
The building board said, this is legislation, waiting if you are not happy, write for everyone in turn.
"Then I wrote to the Riga City Council, but they were handed over to the manager, then the house manager was back to the construction board and then there is a stalemate," Dmitry said.
It is clear from the examination of all the paper kill that construction works have been stopped, although it can be heard sometime that someone works there.
In two months' time, an expert has to be made and, within six months, the owner of the residential habitual carrying out the repairs must have rectified all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but considers it incomplete and superfluous by the construction board.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal apparatus contained in the protective structure is affected, so that there is no certainty that the holder of the subhabitual residence is exposed to a risk.
"That is why we have requested additional clarification from that expert," Ilze Beckka, a spokesman for the city's construction board, said.
Despite the ban on carrying out any repairs at the upper apartment, the construction continues to be heard from there.
The idea of an arbitrary construction without a construction permit amounts to EUR 70 to 700, but in the specific case, the penalty can be much harsher.
As long as an expert opinion is awaited, the Construction Board decided that the two flats should not be exploited, both in the construction works and in the city of Dmitry.
"This is not a case in practice for a construction board where, as a result of its lack of knowledge or simply unwillingness, citizens may pose a threat not only to their own ownership, but also to the holder of their subprime property, as a result of which this owner cannot operate his own property," the spokesman said.
He now has to find another place to live - to relatives, friends, hotels or to rent one's other apartments.
But Dmitry can try to recover from his neighbour through civil justice, which can take up a great deal of time.
Because of the arbitrary nature of construction, it is now forbidden to stay in both flats until the construction engineer makes its conclusion, and it may be expected to wait for up to three weeks.
The loss suffered will have to be borne by the owner of the residential habitat where the repair has taken place.
The holder of this housing, because a construction board has not taken notice of it, is also threatened with a prison term of up to six months.
You can tell you any more.
How do you break down in this balance?
The correct answer is five.
There were five blebts from Kiev in Ukraine near Kiev.
Everyone feels well and sometimes charts the Copper, despite the fact that the common baby is stiffing up.
The conversion of the former Karoe sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost EUR 22 million.
Gita Želve, spokeswoman for Park Hotel Kemeri, has been released to LETA.
The establishment of hotels is the first phase of the rehabilitation of the former boat in Karoe.
The second phase will be "wellness" or a wellbeing clinic scheduled to disappear in 2022, while the opening of the hotel will take place in May 2018.
The elite notes that the costs of accurate clinics are unknown at present.
She points out, however, that it will be located in the casing building of the former Karoe, which has an area of around 12,000 square metres.
The Cliner will be located in three rounds.
Park Hotel Karoe and the owner of the planned clinic are the International Fund, the 'G Capital Europe', which invests in European assets.
Capital Europe owners are several investors investing money into the fund, according to Želson.
George Jos, Executive Director of G Capital Europe, said earlier that a total of EUR 12 to 15 million would be invested in the creation of a former resort, totalling more than €30 million.
The Jurmala City Council plans to leverage €14.5 million from European Union funds, cofinanced by three to four million euros, as has already been reported.
Construction works will be planned by mid-2017, and construction and repair work will start in Autumn 2017.
As reported, the historic "Karoe" laboratory has planned to set up a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Karoe" and "wellness" or "wellness clinic."
However, reconstruction is running long.
In contrast, the 2010 Review claimed that Ominasis was regularly communicating with Kempinski, and had already started to meet daily technical controls in Karoe "and immediately started preparations for the opening of the Kempinma hotel.
In October 2014, Park Hotel Karoe had declared his readiness to buy the Temer sanction unit belonging to Ominasis Latvia, but only one month later, auctioning was declared unfortunate, as the winner did not pay for the purchase in due course.
The selling price was fixed according to the initial price of the last unpaid auction - €2.86 million.
As LETA was informed by the city council's representative Cava Aile, the municipality, by signing a protocol, has shown that through cofinancing from the European Union Structural Funds, it will create an interactive object of natural tourism, roads and parking areas.
The three nominees will be awarded the three laureates.
President Raimonds Vejonis will award Alexander Lukashenko, the three stars of the European Parliament, on 16 August, according to the President's agenda.
The three stars ceremony will take place at 13: 00 CET.

The former NATO commander, Barrdlova, won an email from Russian hake.
The wakers who broke the computers of the National Committee of the Democratic Republic of America (DNC) have also carried out a number of other cyber attacks, including the Serbs of the former chief of NATO, the former chief of the George Sorosa, on Thursday, according to a business-directory "Bloomberg."
The information collected by Hakers has been published on the "DCLeaks.com website."
Amongst other things there is the Bladlova correspondence and news about the work of the Sorosa Institute.
The Institute's computers have been available for a whole year.
According to the Bloomberg, these cyber-attacks were carried out by the same tankers who have broken the DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently examining the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the surge of DNC computers.
In order to enforce the sanctions, the administration will officially have to denounce members of the Democratic Party in a cyber attack, or hake supported by the Russian authorities or the Russian authorities.
As reported, WikiLeaks posted around 20,000 e-mails from the computer systems of the DNC in July, and of which the Democratic Party's leader has been campaigning for the campaign for demolition of democrats in the presidential elections.
As reported in the US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which carries out an investigation into the demolition of democrats, as well as other US special services, is of the opinion that Russia's involvement in cybercrime is unquestionable.
Macarny: The presence of Joko Ono threatened The Beatles.
Paul McCartney said the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of danger to the legendary group The Beatles.
Out was the only woman in the group, George Harvaron, Ringo Site, Lenona and Macayan, who was the only woman in the group to visit the club.
When the singer asked about both relations, his journal Rolling Stone said, 'They are really good'.
We felt threatened at the time.
As we entered, she was sitting on the elevators.
Most of the groups were unable to tolerate it.
We were able to do that, but not very successfully because we were very intense.
We were not sexist, but girls did not usually arrive in newspapers, they were allowed to work.
When John was started to meet with Joko, she was not sitting in the control room but in our four midst.
The director of Yellow Submarine has also recognised that Ringo is now in regular contact, and every time confirms his record of Apple's work plans, but the Beatles have said "dead."
As asked if he still meets the other sole member of a legendary rock, Makartnik Rolling Stone said: "Often not."
We meet in social events and bleaches.
But I am not at the meetings, I feel a little distance from it.
I went away from Apple in a difficult divorce.
I sent John Stramena to the meetings and said, 'Let me tell me what everyone says because I cannot tolerate sitting around the table'.
It was too painful for me to see his own domestic man.
The company is now working in such a way that I am only listening to all the entries.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA Climate Model: Venus ever had an inhabitable planet
Building on the NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once again been an inhabitable planet.
Scientists from the NASA Godarda Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms, which is also used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, the surface of which is a hot where there is no water and whose atmosphere only consists of almost exclusively carbon dioxide, has once had similar conditions for the earth.
Scientists have already mentioned in advance that Venus's slow return rate is attributable to the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus has had a plan, an atmosphere similar to the Earth, and it has turned slowly.
The model also looks at the past topography of Venus.
The planet has had more droughts than on Earth, but there has been enough water and geographical diversity to build life and prevent evaporation.
In early Venus, the sun was 30 per cent more brighter.
The GISS model simulation reveals that the section of the Venus Return model reveals that the daylight part of it lasts for 2 months, explained by GISS scientist Antonijs Del Genio.
This process symbolises the surface of the planet and causes a case which, in turn, is creating a thick cloud layer who acts as an umbrella to protect the planet from the heat of the Solar.
The result is temperate climate temperatures, which are actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth nowadays.
The model illustrates Venus history, which is similar to the evolution theory drawn up by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although it has been inhabitable once, Venus has been subjected to too many heat and ultraviolet rays over several decades.
It lifted the oceans and the guys were burnt down by ultraviolet rays.
It is only the carbon dioxide atmosphere of the plan with lethal greenhouse gas - Venus, as we know it today - that is completely disposed of.
Researchers published the results of the new Venus Climate Model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrik Roy resigned off the Avalanche coacher
On Thursday, the Avalanche coach and the Vice President of the Hockey Operator, Patrick Roy, submitted a request, citing the lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Seneer Vice President and Director General Joe Borg confirmed the news and said that the club would immediately start searching for new coaches.
"For the last three years I have been vigorous, passionate and purposefully carrying out my duties as chief trainer and vice-president of the Colorado club Hockey operation," Roy said in a statement.
During this summer, I have thought a lot about how I could improve team performance in order to give it the bright it needs and achieve higher levels of results.
To achieve this, the viceships of the head coach and the Hockey operation must be fully coincided with the organisation's vision.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to teamwork.
At present these conditions have not been met.
The man who contracted Roam on 23 May 2013 thanked Rose for his contribution to the team.
He said that she informed her of his decision today.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organisation and wish him well in the future.
In his first season with Avalanche's team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognised as the best coacher for the league and received the Jamie Adams Award.
He helped the club to reach 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, while the club was won by the Chrissota chokeyists in the first round of the closing games.
Avalanche concluded the 2015-2016 season with an outcome 39-39-4 with five points behind the Wild team without taking the second special call of the organisers of the Western Conference.
In his career, Roy wrote four Stenley Chesus, two to Montreal Canadiens and two to Avalanche.
North Sea oil platforms relaunch negotiations and strike action
The staff strikes on the salaries of workers in the North Sea oil platforms have been suspended because both parties to the dispute have restarted, according to negotiators.
They have strikes on the North Sea oil platforms, which operate the Royal Dutch Shell.
The joint statement says that the "Wood Group" and "Unite" and RMT trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations on resolving the dispute.
Several full day meetings will take place over the coming weeks, starting early next week with the aim of reconsidering the issues at stake.
The trade unions said their recent events organised after more than 25 years of interruption are against a planned salary cut of 30 percent.
Because of undue market pressure, the Wood Group reduced salaries for workers in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the salaries of terrestrial workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage cuts would allow the company to survive the downward spiral of the market.
Shell has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries in order to optimise its work in preparation for a large-scale mergers deal with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of falling oil prices, and the situation is further aggravated by the British decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, a Scottish MEP, David Martin, met with the workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues of the North Sea strike plan.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the state as a whole need an economy benefiting everyone, not individuals.
In 2016 new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion compared to USD 7 billion in the last five years.
The director sizes the returns rate of a plea star in a plea star.
The latest Capacket Television Mission has helped astronomics to gather the fullest catalogue of the star cut rate of a plea star.
The new data help astronomics to understand why stars turn back at different speeds in this star, as well as the way in which the stars' return rate is attributable to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that, when comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the link between the stars, the age and even the history of the solar system," the news release said.
The picture of a plea star is 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in this star are only beginning to grow, reaching some 125 million years of age.
They go at maximum speed.
With the maximum speed, these rising stars emit a large amount of wind of stars.
When they reach their stars in the magnetic field they put a brake on the stars.
As the stars grow older, their return rate is decreasing.
Cape is measuring the speed of each stars ceiling, determining the time between the appearance of recognisable star areas, such as solar planes.
The latest catalogue of the stars shows that more stars turn back more slowly than smaller stars.
The bubble compares the stars with the defunct, with higher growth dancer carrying out pirates more slowly than a small fruit bottle.
The junk tells me that the Plebes "balt" shows that the rotary rotary sites are larger and more mass, while more rapid rotary ones are very small stars.
The fact that a plea star star is so close to it serves as a wonderful space station where the characteristics of stars can be compared with the turn rates.
The Rebul says that the pless star star helps to shape theoretical models for stars in both directions, both older and younger stars.
We still have much to learn how, when and why the stars' return rate is slowing down and about their complete process of stopping.
The Rebul and his colleagues presented a detailed analysis of the pless ceiling in three new publications to be published shortly in the Jurisomy Journalist.

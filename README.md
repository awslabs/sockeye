# Sockeye

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sockeye/badge/?version=latest)](http://sockeye.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/sockeye.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/awslabs/sockeye)

This package contains the Sockeye project,
a sequence-to-sequence framework for Neural Machine Translation based on MXNet.
It implements the well-known encoder-decoder architecture with attention.

If you are interested in collaborating or have any questions, please submit a pull request or issue.
You can also send questions to *sockeye-dev-at-amazon-dot-com*.
 
## Dependencies

Sockeye requires:
- **Python3**
- [MXNet-0.10.0](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/tree/v0.10.0)
- numpy

Install them with:
```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, dmlc's tensorboard fork is supported to track learning curves (````pip install tensorboard````).

Full dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

## Installation
You have two options for installing sockeye: pip and directly from source.
### pip

```bash
> pip install sockeye
```

### From Source

If you want to just use sockeye without extending it, simply install it via
```bash
> python setup.py install
```
after cloning the repository from git. After installation, command line tools such as
*sockeye-train, sockeye-translate, sockeye-average* 
and *sockeye-embeddings* are available. Alternatively, if the sockeye directory is on your
PYTHONPATH you can run the modules 
directly. For example *sockeye-train* can also be invoked as
```bash
> python -m sockeye.train <args>
```

## First Steps

### Train

In order to train your first Neural Machine Translation model you will need two sets of parallel files: one for training 
and one for validation. The latter will be used for computing various metrics during training. 
Each set should consist of two files: one with source sentences and one with target sentences (translations). Both files should have the same number of lines, each line containing a single
sentence. Each sentence should be a whitespace delimited list of tokens.

Say you wanted to train a German to English translation model, then you would call sockeye like this:
```bash
> python -m sockeye.train --source sentences.de \
                       --target sentences.en \
                       --validation-source sentences.dev.de \
                       --validation-target sentences.dev.en \
                       --use-cpu \
                       --output <model_dir>
```

After training the directory *<model_dir>* will contain all model artifacts such as parameters and model 
configuration. 


### Translate

Input data for translation should be in the same format as the training data (tokenization, preprocessing scheme).
You can translate as follows: 
 
```bash
> python -m sockeye.translate --models <model_dir> --use-cpu
```

This will take the best set of parameters found during training and then translate strings from STDIN and 
write translations to STDOUT.
